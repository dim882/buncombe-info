**Corrine Duncan:**  
Thank you, Avril. I'm Corrine Duncan. I'm the Director of Elections for Buncombe County. I'm here to reassure our community that Buncombe County will vote. All of our staff and board members are accounted for, and despite personal hardship, we've been organizing to make sure this community has a voice in choosing the people that represent us, both in good times and in tragedy. We are now open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to assist you. We have power, but no water. Early voting will begin next week on October 17th. Absentee by mail is happening now, and election day will take place on November 5th.

Obviously, we no longer have access to the facilities or number of poll workers in our original plans. Our office and equipment were spared. We're working with our emergency team and the State Board of Elections to strategize and modify plans. As we speak, the State Board of Elections is meeting to discuss emergency measures to support the needs of affected counties. A virtual press briefing discussing the changes will be held today at 2 p.m. You can find that link at ncsbe.gov.

Locally, we will hold a board meeting tomorrow at 3 p.m. where we will begin processing absentee ballots and discuss modifications to our early voting plan. That meeting is a public meeting and will be held at 59 Woodfin Place in Asheville. Our phone system is spotty, but improving, so call us if you can. If you're able to access the internet, you can find information on our website at buncombecounty.org/vote, including registration forms and the online absentee by mail request portal. Email us with your questions at elections@buncombecounty.org.

An important note, the information on our website about early voting and Election Day will be updated as soon as we are able to solidify plans. We are assessing what voting locations are available and working to make contact with our poll workers to train them. Poll workers, if you're hearing this, training is still happening and we still need you. We're working to find ways to contact you. If you can contact us, please do so. If you're available and you are already signed up for training, show up.

Absentee by mail is available now. We anticipate an increase in this method of voting and are increasing our capacity to meet that demand. All ballots that have been requested so far have been mailed out. Absentee voting is available to any North Carolinian. To request one, use the online portal or a paper form and do so by October 29th. You can return your ballot by mail, in person at our office, or at any early voting location. The deadline to return your ballot is Election Day, November 5th by 7:30 p.m. If you have already requested a ballot and need to change the mailing address due to evacuation, contact us.

In order to vote, you need to be registered. The registration deadline is this Friday, October 11th. You can get the form online or by visiting us. The same applies to checking your status or finding your sample ballot. You can do so by using the NC voter search tool online or by coming to see us. Photo ID for voting, you can also get that for free at our office. We must respect the gravity of our situation. Basic needs come first, recovery is ongoing, and we'll have to be flexible, adapt, and work together, but Buncombe County will have the opportunity to securely vote this election. Thank you.

Now we'll hear from Jessica Silver, Buncombe County Environmental Health.

**Jessica Silver:**  
Good morning. Today I'm going to share an update about well water safety and food service establishments. Your well may have been damaged or flooded, and we highly recommend that flooded or damaged wells be disinfected and sampled prior to using it. A flooded or damaged well must be disinfected. If water went over the top of your well, consider that flooded. Please go to BuncombeCounty.org/EH for instructions on how to disinfect your well.

Second, after disinfecting your well, you'll want to make sure that you get a water sample. There are three ways you can request a water sample. First, you can call 828-422-7000. You can also visit BuncombeCounty.org/EH and make a water sample application online. You can also visit 30 Valley Street Monday through Friday from 8 to 4 and apply in person. We do ask for patience as we visit homes to collect water samples. We are prioritizing impacted areas amid our high call volume. Once we collect the sample, it does take at least 24 hours to run the sample and receive a result.

Environmental health staff are also making visits to food service establishments across the county to make sure they are operating safely. We are working on a way to provide a list of establishments that we have visited. Thank you. 

**Vic Eisley:**  
Good morning. I am Vic Eisley, president and CEO for Explore Asheville and the Buncombe County Tourism Development Authority. Like the rest of our community, Explore Asheville and the Tourism Development Authority have been heartbroken by the devastating personal, natural, and economic loss from Hurricane Helene that our region has endured over just

 the last 10 days, and we are very heartened by the gumption, the grit, the sense of responsibility that our region has shown as a community of this people and place.

We are keeping our Appalachian community top of mind and in our hearts in the wake of this unprecedented tragedy. Communities across Western North Carolina, including ours, are beginning to recover after this devastating wind, flood, and aftermath of Hurricane Helene.

On Thursday, September 26, Explore Asheville published a travel advisory and sent an email alert to our 2,000 area business partners and media, including referrals to hotels open to accepting restaurants needing to take shelter. Little did any of us know what was to come in the next 24 hours for our deeply rooted community. 

In the early hours following the storm, we took stock of our families and neighbors and checked in on the well-being of our team members. We ceased all paid advertising and promotion by Saturday afternoon, September 28th. We shared information via our social channels of what we could assess at that time, and for the time being, we've urged visitors to love us from afar, encouraging them to donate to help people of Asheville and Buncombe County.

Our priority has been and continues to be to care for our residents, workers, and to support the first responders locally and those who have answered the call from all over the country, helping those impacted and addressing the economic and emotional toll at hand.

Through this tragedy, the heart of hospitality has been a beacon of light. Restaurant owners cleaned out their walk-in refrigerators and cooked meals for thousands of residents and first responders. Lodging owners and operators without power, water, and very few staff opened rooms for first responders working 24 to 48 hour shifts. Pools were drained for flushing water to maintain operations as best they could.

In just the last week, we worked together to solve for sourcing clean linens for first responder rooms, and tanker trucks of water to get them operational so they can house more first responders. Our team contacted all groups, conferences, and events through the month of October and encouraged them to rebook Asheville at a later date.

We established a clearinghouse for lodging for first responders, linemen, and emergency workers. First responder organizations or companies providing services, you can now email responderlodging@exploreasheville.com for lodging availability in Buncombe County. 

When FEMA announced on September 29th that federal disaster assistance was made available to the state of North Carolina, including our county, we shared how to apply for federal funding available to affected individuals, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of this disaster.

For individuals that need temporary housing or shelter, you can apply for assistance. Once your application is approved, they provide a list of FEMA-approved lodging options for you. For more information, please go to DisasterAssistance.gov.

In addition to the North Carolina Works Disaster Unemployment for people in our community, Giving Kitchen and Southern Smoke Foundation provide aid for food service employees. The Meetings Industry Fund and the Search Foundation offer grants for members of the meetings and hospitality industry. There's an application process for each.

We are reminding folks that as of October 4th, the U.S. Small Business Administration opened a Small Business Assistance Center with our friends at the Asheville Area Chamber of Commerce at 36 Montford Avenue. The center provides personal business assistance to nonprofits, homeowners, and renters who have been impacted by the storm, offering a place to personally apply for low-cost financial assistance for their recovery. This will provide much-needed loans, but our small, independent business community needs significant grants.

We learned from our friends in places like Puerto Rico that federal grants were also made possible for businesses through the EDA and HUD. We aim to work with our local, state, and federal officials to unlock the much-needed aid for our region that will be required for months to come. We all have a role to play, and together we will provide for our community, charting a pathway forward.

Amid the heartache, there are also rays of light. Just an hour ago, a Concert for Carolina was announced, featuring Luke Combs, Eric Church, Billy Strings, James Taylor, and friends. It will take place October 26th at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, with all proceeds, including sponsorships, going towards aid relief. Explore Asheville and the Tourism Development Authority has pledged $1 million as presenting sponsor. Millions more will flow back to our communities in need thanks to Luke Combs and Eric Church. 

We've been humbled and uplifted by the outpouring of care and concern from fellow destinations, travel, and hospitality friends around the country. Many of them have faced their own challenges and crises in their communities and are now pledging their aid to our travel and hospitality community. We are heartened by their support, so much so that Explore Asheville, our 501(c)(3), excuse me, (c)(6) non-profit, has established the Always Asheville Fund to help our small, independent travel and hospitality businesses throughout the county recover from the devastating impacts of the storm. Assisting our small businesses with emergency grants, not loans, will help sustain this deeply rooted creative community that we all love.

To that end, we are transferring $300,000 from our earned revenue fund into the Always Asheville Fund this week. Destinations International advised they have pledges of $50,000 to begin. More information about the grant process will be available later this week at exploreasheville.com/always-ashville-fund.

We are also exploring other options for recovery in the near, medium, and long haul. This includes evaluating the status of community capital projects that are currently in the Tourism Product Development Fund and the Legacy Investment from Tourism Fund with our partners at the city, county, and non-profit partners. Since 2001, we've committed nearly $100 million to 50 community projects. Early indications are that some of them have sustained damage, including the JBL soccer fields and the Asheville Municipal Golf Course, which was just under renovation. We are going to be partners to help bring community assets back online.

Much like we did during the pandemic, we're gathering ways that people outside of Asheville can purchase art and items online from our local businesses. This storm could not have come at a worse time for our community. Peak October revenues carry many of our businesses and therefore many of our residents through to the spring. Travel and hospitality is 20% of Buncombe County's annual economy. Everything matters for business operations without water flowing, from manufacturing to hospitality, just like for residents. 

We all need realistic information to make the best decisions for families, team members, and businesses. Based on our initial research and outreach thus far, we've determined that nearly 100 local small business partners are closed for the foreseeable future. We need water flowing to reopen commerce. We need commerce flowing to help sustain our resident population and neighborhoods where and when it's safe to do so. We need commerce to help bring back the vibrancy of this creative community. 

We are seeing progress, slow as it may be, and while travel may not be possible right now, we are asking the world to keep Asheville in their heart. When the time is right, we'll be ready to welcome them back with open arms. Until then, we thank them for their love and support as we begin to rebuild. Our comeback is going to come in stages. Other than water, business and infrastructure downtown fared fairly well. In parts of South Asheville, business and residents have power and running water now. Our Asheville Regional Airport is operational. However, places like the River Arts District that took more than two years to build, 20 years of blood, sweat, and tears from local artists and business people, and investment from municipal partners and the Tourism Development Authority, took just 20 hours to destroy a lot, but it did not destroy our spirit.

We are checking in with our friends in Black Mountain, Swannanoa, and Biltmore Village. We're in constant contact with our team and partners at Biltmore, and we are also in touch with the National Park Service about the Blue Ridge Parkway. In the last 10 days, grown men have broken down in tears from exhaustion, grief, and the gravity of it all. Yet, we are witnessing the gumption, the grit, and determination of this deeply rooted community to rise, and we are here for it.

I also just want to share one more thing that came over from Mountain BizWorks on the small business rapid recovery funding. They just announced in a press release form the WNC Strong Helene Business Recovery Fund made possible through a $7.5 million initial funding from the Golden Leaf Foundation. So check in with Mountain BizWorks for more relief on the way. Thank you.

**Deborah Campbell:**  
Good morning. As was stated, I am Deborah Campbell, and I serve as the city manager of Asheville. As usual, I want to begin by expressing my heartfelt thanks for the support the community is providing to help us work through these unprecedented times and circumstances. I am so proud of the work of our community, our city team, especially along with our county, state, federal, private, and non-profit partners who are doing all that they can to assist us with this long-term recovery effort.

Progress is being made every day, and I tell my team, every day has been better than the day before, but we cannot give a timeline as to when we will be fully recovered. Today is day 12 of the emergency response and recovery effort. We continue to focus our attention in these three priority areas: addressing the basic needs of our most vulnerable populations as well as the broader community, water service restoration, and public safety.

115: of Vic Eisley, who is with the TDA to provide an update from their end.
116: - Good morning.
117: I am Vic Eisley, president and CEO for Explore Asheville and the Buncombe County Tourism Development Authority.
118: Like the rest of our community, Explore Asheville and the Tourism Development Authority have been heartbroken by the devastating personal, natural, and economic loss from Hurricane Helene that our region has endured over just the last 10 days, and, we are very heartened by the gumption, the grit, the sense of responsibility that our region has shown us.
119: community of this people and place.
120: We are keeping our Appalachian community top of mind and in our hearts in the wake of this unprecedented tragedy.
121: Communities across Western North Carolina, including ours, are beginning to recover after this devastating wind, flood, and aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
122: On Thursday, September 26, Explore Asheville published a travel advisory and sent an email alert to our 2,000 area business partners and media, including referrals to hotels open to accepting restaurants needing to take shelter.
123: Little did any of us know what was to come in the next 24 hours for our deeply rooted community.
124: In the early hours following the storm, we took stock of our families and neighbors and checked in on the well-being of our team members.
125: We ceased all paid advertising and promotion by Saturday afternoon, September 28th.
126: We shared information via our social channels of what we could assess at that time, and for the time being, we've urged visitors to love us from afar, encouraging them to donate to help people of Asheville and Buncombe County.
127: Our priority has been and continues to be to care for our residents, workers, and to support the first responders locally and those who have answered the call from all over the country, helping those impacted and addressing the economic and emotional toll at hand.
128: Through this tragedy, the heart of hospitality has been a beacon of light.
129: Restaurant owners cleaned out their walk-in refrigerators and cooked meals for thousands of residents and first responders.
130: Lodging owners and operators without power, water, and very few staff, open rooms for first responders working 24 to 48 hour shifts.
131: Pools were drained for flushing water to maintain operations as best they could.
132: In just the last week, we worked together to solve for sourcing clean linens for first responder rooms, and tanker trucks of water to get them operational so they can house more first responders.
133: Our team contacted all groups, conferences, and events through the month of October and encouraged them to rebook Asheville at a later date.
134: We established a clearinghouse for lodging for first responders, linemen, and emergency workers.
135: First responder organizations or companies providing services, you can now email responder lodging at explore Asheville.com for lodging availability in Buncombe County.
136: When FEMA announced on September 29th that federal disaster assistance was made available to the state of North Carolina, including our county, we shared how to apply.
137: for federal funding available to affected individuals, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of this disaster.
138: For individuals that need temporary housing or shelter, you can apply for assistance with Once your application is approved, they provide a list of FEMA-approved lodging options for you.
139: For more information, please go to DisasterAssistance.gov.
140: In addition to the North Carolina Works Disaster Unemployment for people in our community, Giving Kitchen and Southern Smoke Foundation provide aid for... Food Service employees, the Meetings Industry Fund, and the Search Foundation offer grants for members of the meetings and hospitality industry.
141: There's an application process for each.
142: We are reminding folks that as of October 4th the U.S. Small Business Administration opened a Small Business Assistance Center with our are friends at the Asheville Area Chamber of Commerce at 36 Montford Avenue.
143: The center provides personal business, excuse me, provides businesses, nonprofits, homeowners, and renters who have been impacted by the storm, a place to personally apply for low cost financial assistance for their recovery.
144: will provide much-needed loans, but our small, independent business community needs significant grants.
145: We learned from our friends in places like Puerto Rico that federal grants were also made possible for businesses through the EDA and HUD.
146: We aim to work with our local, state, and federal officials to unlock the much-needed for our region that will be needed for months to come.
147: We all have a role to play, and together we will provide for our community, and together we are charting a pathway forward.
148: Amid the heartache, there are also rays of light.
149: Just an hour ago, a Concert for Carolina was announced, featuring lupus, a disease that Combs, Eric Church, Billy Strings, James Taylor, and friends.
150: It will take place October 26th at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, with all proceeds including sponsorships going towards aid relief.
151: Explore Asheville and the Tourism Development Authority has pledged $1 million as presenting sponsor.
152: Millions more will flow back to our communities in need thanks to Luke Combs and Eric Church.
153: We've been humbled and uplifted by the outpouring of care and concern from fellow destinations, travel and hospitality friends around the country.
154: Many of them have faced their own challenges and crises in their communities and are now pledging their aid.
155: aid to our travel and hospitality community.
156: We are heartened by their support, so much so that Explore Asheville, our 501(c)(3) excuse me, (c)(6) non-profit, has established the Always Asheville Fund to help our small, independent travel and hospitality businesses throughout the county recover from the devastating impacts of the storm.
157: Assisting our small businesses with emergency grants, not loans, will aid in part to sustain this deeply rooted creative community that we all love.
158: To that end, we are transferring $300,000 from our earned revenue fund into the Always Asheville Fund this week.
159: at Destinations International advise they have pledges of $50,000 to begin.
160: More information about the grant process will be available later this week at exploreashville.com/always-ashville-fund.
161: We are also exploring other options for recovery in the near, medium, and long haul.
162: This includes evaluating the status of community capital projects that are currently in the Tourism Product Development Fund and the Legacy Investment from Tourism Fund with our partners at the city, county, and non-profit partners.
163: Since 2001 we've committed nearly 100 million dollars to 50 community projects and early indications are that some of them have sustained damage including the JBL soccer fields and the Asheville Municipal Golf Course which was just under renovation.
164: We are going to be able partners to help bring community assets back online.
165: Much like we did during the pandemic, we're gathering ways that people outside of Asheville can purchase art and items online to our local businesses.
166: This storm could not have come at a worse time for our community.
167: Peak October revenues carry many of our businesses and therefore many of our residents through to the spring.
168: Travel and hospitality is 20% of Buncombe County's annual economy.
169: Everything matters for business operations without water flowing, from manufacturing to hospitality, just like us for residents.
170: They and we all need realistic information to be able to make the best decisions for families, team members, and businesses.
171: Based upon our initial research and outreach thus far, we've determined and nearly 100 local small business partners are closed for the foreseeable future.
172: We need water flowing to reopen commerce.
173: We need commerce flowing to help sustain our resident population and neighborhoods where and when it's safe to do so.
174: We need commerce to help bring back the vibrancy of this creative.
175: community.
176: We are seeing progress, slow as it may be, and while travel may not be possible right now, we are asking the world to keep Asheville in their heart and when the time is right, we'll be ready to welcome them back with open arms.
177: Until then, we thank them for their love, support, as we begin to rebuild.
178: Our comeback is going to come in stages.
179: Other than water, business and infrastructure downtown fared fairly well.
180: In parts of South Asheville, business and residents have power and running water now.
181: Our Asheville Regional Airport is operational.
182: However, places like the River Arts District that took more than two years to build, 20 years of blood, sweat, and tears from local artists and business people, and investment from municipal partners and the Tourism Development Authority.
183: It took just 20 years to destroy a lot, but it did not destroy our spirit.
184: We are checking in with our friends in Black Mountain and Swannanoa, Biltmore Village.
185: We're in constant contact with our team and partners at Biltmore, and we are also in touch with the National Park Service about the Blue Ridge Parkway.
186: In the last 10 days, grown men have broken down in tears from exhaustion, grief, and the gravity of it all, and we are witnessing the gumption the grit and determination of this deeply rooted community to rise, and we are here for it.
187: I also just want to share one more thing that came over from Mountain BizWorks on the small business rapid recovery funding.
188: They just announced in a press release form the W. N.C. Strong Helene Business Recovery Fund made possible through a 7.5 million dollar initial funding from the Golden Leaf Foundation.
189: So check in with Mountain BizWorks for more relief on the way.
190: Thank you.
191: Thank you.
192: Before we turn to the city of Asheville, I just have a quick statement from Buncombe County Schools.
193: They will be with us later this week to provide an update, but they wanted to let parents and students know that they are still continuing to work diligently to get students, teachers and staff back in all forty five schools.
194: We'll have an update on a return to school as soon as possible from them.
195: Next, we have city of Asheville here, city manager, Deborah Campbell, assistant city manager, Ben Woody, and chief Lam will provide respective updates.

286: So this is the same worksite.
287: Thank you, and so what you see So you can see the progress on that bypass line overnight, and this next image is a little bit to get a sense of what's going on.
288: So you can see the progress on that bypass line overnight.
289: some context of what that looks like.
290: So a joint and a line is installed incrementally.
291: The red circle you see around that work area is called a shoring box.
292: So the work area has to be stabilized so the workers can be in that box safely and cross this creek bed until we're able to reinstall the bypass line.
293: So that's one of the things that I want to note about that you can see in this picture Again, same work is occurring.
294: You can see the shoring box, and so why this is important is it just shows you the incremental nature of this bypass line and how it's installed, and this is a really important photograph that I want to share.
295: I'm going to talk about this for a minute so what you see again to orient yourself you see the short box on the lower part of the picture and you see where our crews are and on the upper right hand or the top of the picture you see a pipe and that is where I showed the uh the mark our uh drone operator was we showed pictures of him at that location so that's the area that I showed to demonstrate where we lost 25 feet of bank so you see we are making our way to that connection.
296: point.
297: That's where we have to get to to be able to complete this work on the bypass.
298: So what makes this difficult, and what I want to show is you see the area they're working in, those are dry conditions.
299: The area they need to work is still in the creek beds that we talked about.
300: It continues to be fed by the spillway from the dairies.
301: So what has to happen is when they complete this work, where you see the workers that now they will have to go install shorings and have to divert the water that exists there.
302: So we have to have dry areas to be able to install this pipe so you can see the process that it takes to get across this creek bed.
303: The other thing I want to note on.
304: this and this is again important to know how this this happens as we as we sequence this work we've actually removed part of the pipe where you saw our drone operator film on Friday and we did that because so we have we have a longer way to go to connect this bypass line but that's because we were able to put a camera in that line over the weekend and we found that that line was clogged So, as these pipes wash away, the pipes that remain are going to get sediment, boulders, rock, debris in them.
305: So, when we make these connections, we have to make sure that we're connecting to an open pipe.
306: So, the way we dealt with the boulders is we removed that section of the pipe.
307: It was damaged, and that's another segment we have to install.
308: So, that's really the process that you're going to see to get the pipes clean.
309: this bypass line connected, and as I said on Friday, once we can connect the bypass line and put water into that system, that's how we return service to 80% of our water system, and what we were optimistic, we were very hopeful.
310: that we can have this work done on the bypass line in 72 hours.
311: We feel good about that.
312: Things happen, but we want to say that, and once we have the bypass line connected, that is a significant major milestone in the restoration of the water system.
313: But what I want to do today as well, I want to orient the community to the other.
314: piece of restoration and that's and I'm going to take a few minutes to talk about the status of our North Fork Reservoir and Treatment Plant.
315: So this is where the water comes to to charge or to put water into our distribution system.
316: So the picture you see right now that's our North Fork Reservoir.
317: That water source was was purchased and established many many decades ago.
318: decades ago.
319: It is surrounded by 20,000 acres of forest.
320: It is one of the most protected watersheds in the United States.
321: It is often considered to be one of the most pristine sources of drinking water in the United States.
322: This is a crystal clear water body on a normal day.
323: This is a picture, same picture, this is after The storm, and essentially the best way I can describe this water system, or this water body, excuse me, it's effectively like chocolate milk.
324: So it's went from one of the cleanest water supplies in the United States to what I would again, I would term as chocolate milk.
325: It's that murky.
326: So the task at hand for the North Fork Reservoir is that this turbidity, this turbidity, is which is a technical term, but we'll just call it murky water, it the sediment or the turbidity has to begin to settle before we are able to put it into a filter system and clean it.
327: So that's something that we're monitoring, but what happens is every day that passes the turbidity in that water begins to settle.
328: That's a natural process, and that's occurring as we are making these repairs to the distribution system.
329: One of the things that is important to note is we are able to intake water at different depths.
330: So there's different points in the water column that we can get water into the treatment system when it's ready.
331: We were able to change that sort of monitoring the water column.
332: where the water is that has the least amount of turbidity, and that's where we'll be able to get the water from when that time comes.
333: The other thing that I wanna note is we have EPA and FEMA officials that are on site.
334: They're not only providing resources for this recovery effort, but they're providing technical assistance on how we can treat this reservoir.
335: and what we can do to get water back to this community.
336: So again, we have those technical experts that are with us on site, and we're also with those technical experts, we're working on contingency plans to deliver non-potable water to the distribution system while we continue to restore our treatment capacity.
337: So we are looking at every way we can to get water into our distribution system, but I'll remind everybody, none of that can happen until the distribution system is repaired.
338: So these things are happening concurrently.
339: What we hope to do is to be in a position to begin to pressurize the system once the reconstruction of the bypass line is completed.
340: So I'm going to come back and talk about the distribution system in a minute.
341: I didn't advance my slides, but I'm just going to show a couple more pictures on what that looks like, and I need to look, okay.
342: So this, I talked about the turbidity in the reservoir.
343: Well, this is a picture of a filter.
344: So this is where the water comes and it passes through this to be able to be treated.
345: put into the distribution system, and that's very dark, but let me, this is a better picture.
346: So what you see here is the water that's in our water treatment plant on the left.
347: Again, I would describe that as chocolate milk.
348: On the right, that is crystal clear.
349: So that is the difference in the water condition in our treatment plant before and after Hurricane Sandy.
350: So we're going to have to have a plan to treat this.
351: We're going to have to have a plan to treat this.
352: We're going to have to have a plan to treat this.
353: We're going to have to have a plan to treat this.
354: We're going to have to have a plan to treat this.
355: We're going to have to have a plan to treat this.
356: We're going to have to have a plan to treat this.
357: We're going to have to have a plan to treat this.
358: We're going to have to have a plan to treat this.
359: We're going to have to have a talked about that a lot.
360: I have some good news from Mills River.
361: Mills River plant is fully operational and we've actually reduced the pressure at that plant.
362: That sounds counterintuitive, but it's actually really good news because what that means is we've been able to fully pressurize the southern Asheville-Southern Buncombe distribution area.
363: So the area that Mills River services is now fully pressurized and that's really good news because one is it means if you have water you should not lose water in the South Asheville area but the other thing that it means is we do not have any major breaks in the southern distribution system.
364: Now we may still find small breaks as we begin to recover but that's great news from Mills.
365: So we have a long way to go.
366: So we have a long way to go.
367: So we have a long way to go.
368: to the distribution system, we-- We've talked a lot about this, we showed a lot of imagery on Friday, but our contractors continue to make progress on large-scale repairs to our primary transmission lines.
369: Those contractors for the city are TP Howard and Tanoka.
370: We are also working closely with NCDOT and their contractors, and we are all working together to make these critical repairs.
371: to the distribution system as we find them and as we have materials available.
372: One thing I want to note, I want to just give a little bit of a challenge on that.
373: So we are, we were having to restore water, a water system and roads and do the design work.
374: The engineering is actually happening in the field as the work occurs.
375: Normally you would have the engineers in the office, they would do the design work.
376: then we would do a bid and do the construction so all this is happening at once.
377: So we have the contractors have their engineers, we have ours, we are engineering and building concurrently to restore the distribution system, and so we can talk more about this but it's important to know that the way we've sequenced that repair to the distribution system.
378: is we we begin at the points that are closest to the source of water so we want to make sure that the distribution system that is in the closest proximity to North Fork water treatment plant those need to be repaired first and then we'll make our repairs out into the larger system and we do it in that manner because that's the manner that the water is going to go into the system.
379: It's going to start closest to the source and then it's going to make its way out into the other areas of the system, and the last thing I want to note is also want to make everybody where our city of Asheville water crews had a couple of questions on the number of employees.
380: I've confirmed that we have 181 employees in the city of Asheville's water department.
381: They are also making repairs in preparation.
382: the restoration process.
383: So this includes they're out assessing making repairs as they're found and I want to be clear as the system pressurizes in the coming weeks we will continue to find new breaks and leaks so it's important to know that there are many many breaks and leaks that we are not even aware of yet and we won't know those until we are able to pressurize the system.
384: the system and that concludes my comments for today, and I'm going to turn it over to police chief Mike Lamb.
385: Thank you.
386: Thank you, Ben, and good morning is I guess three minutes more of the morning.
387: Mike Lamb, I'm the chief of police for the Asheville Police Department and I'll be updating you on public safety and law enforcement operations within the city of Asheville.
388: So currently we are operating with full patrol staffing and also full detective staffing and we have 20 percent more officers that are volunteering to come in on their days off on average.
389: These dedicated teams are working to find missing persons, to do drone and search and rescue operations.
390: We're doing outside resource management and also we have additional roving patrols in areas to prevent theft and burglary.
391: So with our missing persons thus far we have located We are currently working with people that are missing and not heard from.
392: Of those 60, 20 of those are folks that are missing and not heard from.
393: We are also working with people that are missing and not heard from.
394: We are also working with people that are missing and not heard from.
395: unhoused.
396: We have distributed face sheets to our officers so that they are aware of these missing persons so that if they locate them in the community that they can call us and that they can take them off the sheet.
397: We're also receiving substantial assistance from the FBI and also Homeland Security in helping us with the missing persons list but also helping us to to identify deceased persons that we are recovering.
398: We're also receiving additional DNA resources, DNA rapid testing instruments, and consumables from donations from private sector.
399: Silence We're very appreciative of the donations of the material that helps us to be able to identify deceased persons and give closure to families.
400: So over the weekend, we did a total of five rescues from our missing persons and welfare checks.
401: I'll speak of two of those rescues.
402: rescues bad situation where she was running out of the critical oxygen that she needs in order to survive.
403: She had no cell phone coverage and was blocked in by downed trees to her house.
404: So officers were able to get her the medical attention and the oxygen that she needs, and they were also able to facilitate trees being removed from her driveway so that resources could get in and out.
405: of her house.
406: The other one was a man who had broken his leg.
407: He had no cell phone coverage and he also was blocked in.
408: So officers were able to get him the critical medical attention that he needed.
409: So from our deceased persons list, and I wanna clarify that this is within the city limits of Asheville.
410: covered nine deceased persons and again we it was we were very thankful for the help from the FBI and Homeland Security on helping us to recover and identify those persons and also our search and rescue teams.
411: With our drone team we are working affected zones in and around the Swannanoa River and also the French Broad River.
412: We're working alongside search and rescue.
413: rescue teams from the Asheville Fire Department, but also New Jersey Search and Rescue, and we're also receiving substantial assistance from our private sector, from companies like Axon, Airworks, DroneSense, and Paladin in helping us with additional pilots and additional resources for these critical drone operations.
414: So, we have a lot of outside agencies that are also assisting us.
415: We have over 45 independent law enforcement agencies from across the state and nation that are providing assistance to us by giving us more resources so that we can be in more places to prevent more crime.
416: We're also managing on average 190 officers every 24 hours.
417: They are protecting critical infrastructure and also augmenting patrols for areas again that are experiencing violent crime and also theft and burglaries.
418: Currently, we're working at a 40 percent higher call volume compared to the last three years during this time.
419: That's an average of 85 more calls a day that officers are responding to.
420: Oh Over the past two days, we have been able to capture a homicide suspect from the one homicide and the two attempted homicides that we had last week.
421: So of those incidents, we have been able to recover and arrest every one of those suspects, and over the weekend, we arrested three different individuals that were going around barricades to loot businesses.
422: So we're thankful that we were able to arrest those three and also from the help from the Holly Springs Police Department and helping us locate those people, and again, those additional resources that we have.
423: So I wanna remind everyone that we have a curfew.
424: The curfew is in effect from 7.30 p.m. to 7.30 a.m. Now we realize that businesses are opening back.
425: up and water is being restored to certain areas of Asheville.
426: So as that happens, we will reevaluate the curfew and try and do what's best for the community overall.
427: As a reminder to the public, please be aware of scammers.
428: Scammers are coming into our area in order to take advantage of survivors.
429: Never give cash to anyone representing themselves as a contractor.
430: We want to thank you for your time and for your company's support.
431: We're thankful for the We provided a lot of information today in this 11 a.m. briefing.
432: A few key things that we want to touch on before we open it up to questions from the media who are on a Zoom link.
433: As of the morning update from Duke Energy, we still have 67,000 customers who are without power.
434: board of elections meeting will take place Tuesday at 3 30 p.m not 3 p.m. anyone who has questions about election services you can call the election services office at 8 2 8 2 5 0 4 2 0 0 again 8 2 8 2 5 0 4 2 0 0 if you have They can help answer your questions so you don't have to try to get into the office.
435: They'll do what they can over the phone for you, and then there were some comments in the Facebook chat about WastePro bins.
436: They didn't get collected at the end of the day.
437: If those bins did not get collected, that means that WastePro could not make it to your service area that day.
438: Pull those back in.
439: We have... extended hours at the landfill and we'll continue expanding that WastePro service as roads begin to be restored.
440: So with that, we will turn it over with two questions from the media in the Zoom chat.
441: Question for Corinne Duncan, Mark Barrett with the New York Times.
442: What concerns does she have that the difficult that elections will face, like a lot of other things in our society today, will decrease turnout.
443: Sure, and just one thing with Corrine, the spelling of her name is C-O-R-I-N-N-E, Duncan, and it's pronounced Corrine.
444: Sorry about that.
445: Thanks.
446: Just for folks who are writing, I'll turn it over to Corrine.
447: Thank you, Lillian.
448: So we're in the initial stages of assessing our voting locations and trying to contact our poll workers in order to make a plan for in-person voting.
449: In general, early voting tends to be the most popular option because it has flexibility, so we're really trying to prioritize that and focus on that right now.
450: The State Board of Elections will also be providing some flexibility, hopefully.
451: They met during this briefing, so we'll get some more information on that as we go.
452: Concerns for us, specifically, are the water situation, so making sure that we have sanitary.
453: conditions at the polling locations, we get porta-potties, those kind of things, and we're working with the state board to address those issues and we are getting support.
454: Laura Lee from Blue Ridge Public Radio had some questions for Ben.
455: Hey, Ben, thank you so much for all that information.
456: I just want to make sure that we understood this correctly.
457: So it's about 72 hours for the bypass line to be connected, and then once that happens, the next steps are with the distribution lines.
458: and we don't yet have a timeframe on that, and it sounds like, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong here, it sounds like the lines that are gonna get fixed first are the ones closest to the plant.
459: Can we infer from that that people who live closest to the plant are gonna get restoration of water soonest, or is it something where the lines have to be, you know, fully repaired and throughout a system before you can start pumping water into it?
460: So I really appreciate that question actually and thank you because I do want to make sure I'm clear on what we're saying here and you were correct in your assessment.
461: So we've talked about the bypass line a lot and the importance of that particular part of the infrastructure.
462: So yes what I am saying is that we hope to have that installed or connected later this week.
463: So that's what the 72 hours is, nothing more than that pipe.
464: That is it.
465: I just want to be clear on that, and that is a remarkable feat because if you saw the conditions that exist when they started, they have engineered, designed, our contractors mobilize, and they are going to build that, rebuild that in a matter of a little over a week.
466: That is remarkable and amazing progress.
467: we just wanted to share that.
468: But you are also correct that doesn't mean that we can put water in that pipe in 72 hours.
469: That doesn't mean that the rest of the distribution system is prepared to accept water.
470: So I am only saying that pipe is done and I will say today our restoration to water is still measured in weeks not days.
471: So I just want to be clear on that.
472: but also acknowledge that that's perceptive you're right when water restoration does begin it will happen closest to the source of the water and it will spread out from there so the closest and the lowest elevation areas will likely receive water first and it builds from there.
473: Also important to note that restoration requires requires, it's methodical, we have to make sure pressures are correct, we have to look for lines that may explode when we pressurize them, so it is a systematic, methodical process to restore water, and I do it, again, I appreciate the question on the clarification.
474: Thank you.
475: Thank you.
476: you mentioned the and you showed us the dry conditions in that area that you need to to be able to work and then that you still have water in the creek um so is it basically that you have to get that bypass line in over the next 72 hours before you can um shore up upstream to keep that creek from from the work that you need to do yes we have to get that bypass line under our new creek so yes that and that is that again that has to happen in sections because we're not able to do that work when there's water there so they have to put in shoring you know do a lot of gratings required to do this so yes yes once we get the bypass line under the creek we'll have another elbow and we'll be able to connect To the line that you saw in the photograph where our drone operator was on Friday Great thank you.
477: I have some other water questions, but they're about like water distribution for city or county managers Okay, thank you.
478: Thank you What's your question Laura I have a couple one is about non-potable water distribution.
479: We have a reporter who's at the Asheville Middle School site and our understanding is that they are not distributing non- potable water there.
480: I want to make sure that we heard clearly the the messages that there is non-potable water at all of the city and county sites and then if you have clarification on why there might not be that distribution at the middle school we'd love to know that as well.
481: I see the city manager walking this way.
482: I'll defer that to city manager Debra Campbell.
483: Hello again and the information that I have is that there should be water available.
484: for flushing and I don't know if that if it is categorized as non-potable but it should you should have and be able to get water for flushing we can share that we can share that with the city's PIO team and have them follow up with you directly on that response >> DIRECTOR HAMPSON: Thank you.
485: Can I ask a couple of questions of Vic Eisley.
486: >> DIRECTOR RIVERA-SMITH: Vic is walking this way.
487: >> DIRECTOR HAMPSON: Great.
488: >> DIRECTOR RIVERA-SMITH: Good afternoon.
489: >> DIRECTOR HAMPSON: Afternoon.
490: Just wanted to ask sort of a broad.
491: question for people who may not have full understanding of how the TDA functions and what the parameters are in terms of regulations about how that money is permitted to be expended and wondering if there has been any leniency.
492: We've had a lot of reporting prior to the storm about the state law requirement that you have to use funds for infrastructure.
493: and some portion and the rest to promote tourism.
494: Is there a latitude on the state regulations about how you were able to allocate that money?
495: - Thank you.
496: In the state of North Carolina, each county has its own legislation that is passed through the North Carolina General Assembly.
497: Ours was changed, Buncombe County.
498: was changed two years ago to form to the state guidelines, which is two-thirds to marketing and promotion and one-third to capital community projects.
499: That is what our legislation is today and we are bound by that.
500: That's why when we're looking at the establishing the always.
501: Asheville fund is we have what's called an earned revenue fund which comes from advertising revenue share or bookings from our website at explore Asheville dot-com so it is not it's not not restricted the way the occupancy tax funds are so we were we are able to put that into the always Asheville fund to work for micro grants for our small business community and how much is in that earned revenue fund?
502: So we're transferring $300,000 into the Always Asheville fund.
503: There's $370,000 in it today and then we have $50,000 in pledges to start from destinations and travel and hospitality partners around the country and that's just the beginning, and if you had any indication from lawmakers as you said there's statutory requirement for this expenditure that they might offer some flexibility or latitude given the tremendous circumstances we're under?
504: That's a great question and we all have a role to play and that's where we're you know into talking with our city and county officials which definitely have their hands full with FEMA and Corps of Engineers and that core infrastructure.
505: that Ben just talked about.
506: We do know that the North Carolina legislature goes back into session Wednesday this week.
507: My understanding is there's gonna be discussion about a big relief opportunity, whether one's tabled or not, I am unsure of, but I know that it is definitely on the minds of our legislature in.
508: in North Carolina, both Tim Moore and Phil Berger were here in Asheville on Friday, and I know that all of our local delegations have been very active as well.
509: We've been in discussions with them, but I think they're a bigger fish to fry in terms of the scale of what's needed in terms of relief for our community, and as I mentioned in my comments, before there are assets that were currently under renovation and that we're looking really good like the Asheville Municipal Golf Course, the WNC Nature Center, as well as the JBL soccer field.
510: So we need to do an assessment with our city and county partners of which of those are still viable projects, and I think we'll probably get to that sometime.
511: later later next week.
512: It's just putting things in motion and in order here.
513: >> DIRECTOR RANKIN: And if we understood your comments earlier correctly you you are pausing on advertising obviously in the present moment.
514: Do you have a time frame that you anticipate how long that might be and could you talk a little bit about balancing.
515: OUT tourism with the needs to respond.
516: - Laura, you were going in and out there for a moment, but yes, we have paused all paid advertising and the million dollar sponsorship that we are doing.
517: Yep, absolutely.
518: Sorry, is there anyone there?
519: Yeah, it's a beauty.
520: Thank you.
521: Thank you.
522: I'm going to have a look at the live stream and make sure it's recording.
523: I'm going to double check the live stream.
524: Oh.
525: Oh.
526: Okay.
527: Hi, again, Laura, could you repeat the question?
528: Sure.
529: I was just asking about your pause on advertising and how long you might anticipate that would be, and then also sort of balancing the need for tourism revenue against the obvious, you know, tremendous loss and restoration you're trying to, we're trying to get done here.
530: Yes.
531: As I mentioned in my comments, we believe the comeback will come in stages and in pockets.
532: We want to make sure that that there's infrastructure available for our residents, workers, and emergency responders that are helping put our community back together, and as you have seen, you know, downtown looks relatively as it would on any day in October and River Arts District does not, and so we wanna make sure that we're working through safe to open for commerce, making sure that that's for our residents as well as guests from within our community.
533: So we're going to be working with folks here and with our colleagues at Visit NC, which is the state tourism office.
534: Great, and I just had one question for Police Chief Lamb.
535: I'm sorry, I don't know whether the connection set that or not.
536: Hey, Laura.
537: Hi, thanks for all that you all are doing.
538: I wanted to ask about the missing people that you said we are still -- you all are still actively looking for.
539: I'm wondering if you -- considered making that ID known if there's ways that the public could assist in trying to to find and identify those people?
540: So yeah, we are working with the Register of Deeds office and sharing that information back and forth with them between folks that are missing within Buncombe County because we've we've received some addresses out in the county and also in Henderson County.
541: So we're working together with Buncombe County, the Register of Deeds, with Henderson County and again also with our federal partners to make sure that we're not duplicating work, and again you know we had 383 missing persons I think total and then we've whittled it down to where there's there's the 60.
542: But I believe believe that we can look at doing some kind of face sheet, especially for our unhoused folks, so that we can have the public's help in identifying them and taking them off the list.
543: - Great, thank you.
544: Just so we can understand sort of what the Register of Deeds is doing relative to what you all are doing, 'cause we understand those numbers are several hundred than that is that list just because it's a wellness checklist and you all have people that you know are missing I'm just trying to understand why that number might be so much higher than than the 60 that you mentioned.
545: Yeah so the Register of Deeds they have all sorts of folks like folks whose phones may not be working who they're they're just going to check on so not actually the same main list that the Asheville Police is working from, but where those volunteers can assist, they are doing so.
546: So that's why you see two different lists.
547: The Asheville Police list is more around specific needs and specific concerns, and so that wraps up about the time that we have.
548: I did want to provide an update from City of Asheville on those water distribution sites.
549: They do have bulk water there that you can use for flushing and so bring your own containers for those bulk water sites and they will get you taken care of with water for both drinking and flushing.
550: We thank you for joining us.
551: us here today.
552: We will be back at 11 a.m. tomorrow for our next community update.
553: We know that folks are using their precious car batteries to listen to this in areas where there's still no power and so we appreciate you joining us and tuning in and we will talk to you again tomorrow.
554: Thank you.

### 4:00 p.m. October 4th Community Briefing

**Lillian Govis (Director of Communications and Public Engagement, Buncombe County):**  
Engagement. We're here today at the 4 p.m. October 4th community briefing. This afternoon we'll be joined by Mission HVA, VA Hospital, and the City of Asheville. First, I'll turn this over to our Buncombe County Manager, Avril Pinder.

**Avril Pinder (Buncombe County Manager):**  
Thank you, Lillian. Good afternoon. In our 10 a.m. briefing this morning, there were questions about testing water, soils, and wells. We reached out to the EPA for guidance. They are aware of potential issues and they are working to evaluate health concerns. In the interim, if you have concerns, please exercise an abundance of caution. This is not the time to do stream cleanups unless you are part of an official agency or organization. We know that a number of materials were swept into the rivers from industrial facilities, houses, farms, and more, and we all want to restore our community back to its natural beauty as quickly as possible, but please hold off until we have assurance from the experts that it is safe to do so.

If you have a well and aren't sure if your water is safe to drink, boil it at a minimum for one minute or use it only for flushing toilets. We also had a question about safe reopenings of child care and we'll follow up with more on that at tomorrow morning's 10 a.m. briefing. I want to remind folks that we have set up a warehouse at Sitts Commerce Way in Arden to receive hurricane relief supplies. We can receive donations from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. daily. Any size vehicle is welcome. We have seven categories of things that we can't accept.

We cannot accept baby food, glass items, furniture, clothing, perishable foods, electronics, and flammable liquids. We will not distribute from this location. Patients will go to community partners to distribute, so please do not come here to receive supplies.

We also want to remind people to sign up for our alerts at www.buncombecounty.org/codered, or by texting DCALERT to 99411. We are sending these updates out after each community briefing. Our medics are operating a medical clinic that is up and running in Black Mountain at 12 Florida Avenue in Black Mountain and can provide medical care for non-emergency or urgent care needs, except for withdrawals. They are operating 24/7.

Virtual hospitality will be serving up free hot food—hot dogs, shrimp and grits, fish and chips, and drinking water—tomorrow, Saturday, October 5th, starting at 12:30 p.m. at the Quality Inn and Suites at 1430 Tunnel Road. Please bring your containers with free water tomorrow at Tunnel Road, 1430, from 12 p.m. until supplies last. With that, I'll turn it back over to Lillian.

**Lillian Govis:**  
Next, we will hear from City of Asheville Manager, Debra Campbell.

**Debra Campbell (City of Asheville Manager):**  
Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for having us. I want to first thank everyone for their tireless efforts and recovery efforts that are ongoing in our community. Our hearts continue to go out to those in our community that have suffered tragedy and hardship during this time. I appreciate all those that are working to care for so many individuals that are needing help.

I also want to thank our colleagues here at Mission Health for the exceptional job that they have done in the midst of a challenging personal situation. Their dedication to our patient care has been inspiring and we're moving mountains to support them.

**Mission HCA Representative:**  
Good afternoon. We currently have stable power at Mission Hospital. We're still without municipal water, but we have created a system with pressurized water, and everything is potable within our facility. We are under water conservation but fully operational.

Our outpatient clinics are opening as they are deemed safe, and we have focused on supporting our caregivers, offering them resources such as hotels, laundry, and fuel. We also have an employee-funded HOPE Fund, which supports our staff financially through this difficult time.

All emergency departments are open, and we're here to serve the community.

---

**Dr. Asher Sanadin (Chief of Staff, Western North Carolina VA Healthcare System):**  
Good afternoon. Our healthcare system represents four sites of care: Hickory, Franklin, and the Master Sergeant Jerry K. Crump Clinic in Forest City, along with the Asheville VA Medical Center.

We are under both emergency generator and traditional power and have been able to perform limited surgical interventions. Most routine appointments were converted to virtual options, but our clinicians triaged patients to prioritize high-acuity cases.

Veterans can come to the pharmacy or any retail pharmacy within the community care network for a 30-day supply of medications. We also have home-based primary care and have been reaching out to our patients to confirm their safety.

Our shelters, in collaboration with Buncombe County, have social workers and pharmacists on-site to assist veterans, and we are planning to replicate this in other counties. Additionally, we have water deliveries and communication systems fully operational.

---

**Debra Campbell:**  
Thank you, Dr. Sanadin. Now, I'll provide an update on the City's priorities. Our number one priority is getting water, food, and necessities to vulnerable populations. Second is the restoration of Asheville's water distribution system. Assistant City Manager Ben Woody will provide updates, and Deputy Chief Sean Artema will share public safety and missing persons data.

Today, MREs and bottled water are available at three distribution sites. We're also working on debris collection and limited fare-free transit starting Monday.

---

**Ben Woody (Assistant City Manager, City of Asheville):**  
Good afternoon. The North Fork Water Treatment Plant provides 80% of our water, and we have crews working tirelessly to repair the damage. The Mills River plant is fully operational, but it only serves 20% of the system. We've made significant progress repairing waterlines, and we expect to restore service soon.

I'll pause here for any questions.

---

**Deputy Chief Sean Artema (Asheville Police Department):**  
We've had 300 missing persons reported, 270 of which have been located. We're actively investigating 75 cases with assistance from the FBI and Homeland Security. We've utilized rapid DNA testing to rescue several individuals. We also had one homicide and one arson case recently, so please remain vigilant.

**Lillian Govis:**  
Thank you, Deputy Chief. As a reminder, we'll continue these briefings through the weekend.

Now we'll hear from Jessica Silver, Bunkham County Environmental Health. Good morning. Today I'm going to share an update about well water safety and food service establishments. Your well may have been damaged or flooded and we highly recommend that flooded or damaged wells be disinfected and sampled prior to using it. A flooded or damaged well must be disinfected. If water went over the top of your well, we consider that flooded. Please go to Bunkham County dot org slash EH for instructions on how to disinfect your well. Second, after disinfecting your well, you'll want to make sure that you get a water sample. There are three ways you can request a water sample. First, you can call 828-250-5016. You can also visit Bunkham County dot org slash EH and make a water sample application online. You can also visit 30 Valley Street Monday through Friday from 8 to 4 and apply in person. We do ask for patients as we visit homes to collect water samples. We are prioritizing impacted areas amid our high-call volume. Once we collect the sample, it does take at least 24 hours to run the sample and receive a result. Environmental health staff are also making visits to food service establishments across the county to make sure they are operating safely. We are working on a way to provide a list of establishments that we have visited. Thank you. Next, we have Vic Eisley, who is with the TDA to provide an update from their int. Good morning. I am Vic Eisley, president and CEO for Explore Asheville and the Bunkham County Tourism Development Authority. Like the rest of our community, Explore Asheville and the Tourism Development Authority have been heartbroken by the devastating personal, natural, and economic loss from Hurricane Helene that our region has endured over just the last 10 days. And we are very heartened by the gumption, the grit, the sense of community of this people in place. We are keeping our Appalachian community top of mind and in our hearts in the wake of this unprecedented tragedy. Communities across Western North Carolina, including ours, are beginning to recover after this devastating wind, flood, and aftermath of Hurricane Helene. On Thursday, September 26, Explore Asheville published a travel advisories and sent an email alert to our 2000 area business partners and media, including referrals to hotels open to accepting restaurants needing to take shelter. Little did any of us know what was to come in the next 24 hours for our deeply rooted creative community. In the early hours following the storm, we took stock of our families and neighbors and checked in on the well-being of our team members. We ceased all paid advertising and promotion by Saturday afternoon, September 28. We shared information via our social channels of what we could assess at that time. And for the time being, we've urged visitors to love us from afar, encouraging them to donate to help people of Asheville and Buncombe County. Our priority has been and continues to be to care for our residents, workers, and to support the first responders locally, and those who have answered the call from all over the country, helping those impacted and addressing the economic and emotional toll at hand. Through this tragedy, the heart of hospitality has been a beacon of light. Restaurant owners cleaned out their walk-in refrigerators and cooked meals for thousands of residents and first responders, lodging owners and operators without power, water, and very few staff, open rooms for first responders working 24 to 48 hour shifts. Pools were drained for flushing water to maintain operations as best they could. In just the last week, we worked together to solve for sourcing clean linens for first responder rooms, port-a-potties and tanker trucks of water to get them operational so they can house more first responders. Our team contacted all groups, conferences and events through the month of October, and encouraged them to re-book Asheville at a later date. We established a clearing house for lodging for first responders, linemen, and emergency workers. For first responder organizations or companies providing services, you can now email responder lodging@exploreashville.com for lodging availability in Buncom County. When FEMA announced on September 29th, the federal disaster assistance was made available to the state of North Carolina, including our county, we shared how to apply for federal funding available to affected individuals, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of this disaster. For individuals that need temporary housing or shelter, you can apply for assistance with FEMA. Once your application is approved, they provide a list of FEMA approved lodging options for you. For more information, please go to disasterassistance.gov. In addition to the North Carolina Works Disaster Unemployment for people in our community, Giving Kitchen and Southern Smoke Foundation provide aid for food service employees, the Meetings Industry Fund, and the Search Foundation offer grants for members of the meetings and hospitality industry. There's an application process for each. We are reminding folks that as of October 4, the U.S. Small Business Administration opened a small business assistance center with our friends at the Asheville area Chamber of Commerce at 36 Montford Avenue. The center provides personal business, excuse me, provides businesses, nonprofits, homeowners, and renters who have been impacted by the storm, a place to personally apply for low-cost financial assistance for their recovery. FEMA and SBA will provide much-needed loans, but our small independent business community needs significant grants. We learned from our friends in places like Puerto Rico that federal grants were also made possible for businesses through the EDA and HUD. We aim to work with our local, state, and federal officials to unlock the much-needed resources for our region that will be needed for months to come. We all have a role to play and together we will provide for our community and together we are charting a pathway forward. Amid the heartache, there are also rays of light. Just an hour ago, a concert for Carolina was announced featuring loop combs, Eric Church, Billy Strings, James Taylor, and Friends. It will take place October 26th at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, with all proceeds including sponsorships going towards aid relief. Explore Asheville and the Tourism Development Authority has pledged $1 million as presenting sponsor. Millions more will flow back to our communities in need thanks to loop combs and Eric Church. We've been humbled and uplifted by the outpouring of care and concern from fellow destinations, travel and hospitality friends around the country. Many of them have faced their own challenges and crises in their communities and are now pledging their aid to our travel and hospitality community. We are heartened by their support. So much so that Explore Asheville our 501c3, excuse me, C6 nonprofit has established the Always Asheville Fund to help our small independent travel and hospitality businesses throughout the county recover from the devastating impacts of the storm. Assisting our small businesses with emergency grants, not loans, will aid in part to sustain this deeply rooted creative community that we all love. To that end, we are transferring $300,000 from our earned revenue fund into the Always Asheville Fund this week. Our friends at Destinations International advised they have pledges of $50,000 to begin. More information about the grant process will be available later this week at ExploreAshville.com. Always Asheville Fund. We are also exploring other options for recovery in the near medium and long haul. This includes evaluating the status of community capital projects that are currently in the tourism product development fund and the legacy investment from tourism fund with our partners at the city, county and nonprofit partners. Since 2001, we've committed nearly $100 million to 50 community projects and early indications are that some of them have sustained damage, including the JBL soccer fields and the Asheville Municipal Golf Course, which was just under renovation. We are going to be able partners to help bring community assets back online. Much like we did during the pandemic, we're gathering ways that people outside of Asheville can purchase art and items online to sustain our local businesses. This storm could not have come at a worst time for our community. Peak October revenues carry many of our businesses and therefore many of our residents through to the spring. Traveling hospitality is 20% of Buncom County's annual economy. Nothing matters for business operations without water flowing from manufacturing to hospitality, just like us for residents. They and we all need realistic information to be able to make the best decisions for families, team members and businesses. Based upon our initial research and outreach thus far, we've determined nearly 100 local small business partners are closed for the foreseeable future. We need water flowing to reopen commerce. We need commerce flowing to help sustain our resident population and neighborhoods where and when it's safe to do so. We need commerce to help bring back the vibrancy of this creative community. We are staying progress, slow as it may be. And while travel may not be possible right now, we are asking the world to keep Asheville in their heart. And when the time is right, we'll be ready to welcome them back with open arms. Until then, we thank them for their love, support as we begin to rebuild. Our comeback is going to come in stages. Other than water, business infrastructure downtown fared fairly well. In parts of South Asheville, business and residents have power and running water now. Our Asheville Regional Airport is operational. However, places like the River Arts District that took more than 20 years of blood, sweat and tears from local artists and business people and investment from municipal partners and the tourism development authority. It took just 20 years to destroy a lot, but it did not destroy our spirit. We are checking in with our friends in Black Mountain in Swananoa, built more village. We're in constant contact with our team and partners at Builtmore. And we are also in touch with the National Park Service about the Blue Ridge Parkway. In the last 10 days, grown men have broken down in tears from exhaustion, grief and the gravity of it all. And we are witnessing the gumption, the grit and determination of this deeply rooted community to rise. And we are here for it. I also just want to share one more thing that came over from Mountain Bizworks on the small business Rapid Recovery Funding. They just announced and impressed in a press release form the WNC Strong Helene Business Recovery Fund made possible through a $7.5 million initial funding from the Golden Leif Foundation. So check in with Mountain Bizworks for more relief on the way. Thank you. Thank you. Before we turn to the City of Asheville, I just have a quick statement from Buncombe County Schools. They will be with us later this week to provide an update, but they wanted to let parents and students know that they are still continuing to work diligently to get students, teachers and staff back in all 45 schools and we'll have an update on a return to school as soon as possible from them. Next, we have City of Asheville here, City Manager Deborah Campbell, Assistant City Manager Ben Woody, and Chief Lamb will provide respective updates. Thank you. Good morning. As was stated, I am Deborah Campbell and I serve as the City Manager of Asheville. And as usual, I want to begin by expressing my heartfelt thanks for the support the community is providing to help us work through these unprecedented times and circumstances. I am so proud of the work of our community, our city team, especially along with our county, state, federal, private and nonprofit partners who are doing all that they can to assist with this long-term recovery effort. Progress is being made every day and I tell my team every day has been better than the day before. But we cannot give a timeline as to when we will be fully recovered. Today is day 12 of the emergency response and recovery effort. We continue to focus our attention in these three priority areas, address the basic needs of our most vulnerable populations as well as the broader community. I'll be giving a little bit more information about that. A water service restoration and as you heard, Assistant Ben Woody will be providing that update and public safety. Chief Mike Lamb will provide that update. I did have a lot of information about water distribution but I think that you all have heard that from the county manager. So I will skip in terms of distribution and location sites and focus on just a little bit of data. As of our last report, the teams that our distribution sites have distributed over 250,000 bottles of water. Nearly 5,000 gallons of bulk water have been distributed. Nearly 11,000 meals ready to eat have been distributed and 162 cans of baby formula. We urge anyone who has been affected by this natural disaster to connect with FEMA's disaster, survivor assistance teams to register for support. If you have received damage to your home, Ben without electricity are Ben out of work. Please, please register with FEMA to get the support you need. You can call 1-800-621-3362 or download the FEMA app on your cell phone or visit one of the sites to talk with someone in person. These sites are changing daily to best meet the needs of those needing help. So today's sites will run from approximately 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Staff from FEMA will be available to help sign people up for FEMA resources at the following locations. AB Tech Shelter. That is AB Tech Conference Center 16 Fernahars Drive between Conference Center between the Conference Center and the Parking Deck. Pack Square Park at 70 court plaza in downtown Asheville. New Bridge Baptist Church. 199 Alcoa Wood Avenue in Asheville. Isaac Dixon Elementary School at 125 Hill Street. For our Spanish speaking community, FEMA representatives will be on site in the Emma community at 528 Emma Street. Now I'd like to give a little bit of information about city operations. City staff have been working around the clock to get our community back up and running. So today I shared just a few highlights from our incredible public works teams. As of this morning, they have cleared over 1,300 trees, reopened 57 roads, continue to work tirelessly in extreme conditions to address wash start roads, slides and sinkholes, which means that we have a long way to go and more of these issues to address. They've logged over 8,900 staff hours in support of disaster recovery efforts. Sanitation trash collection is beginning today and will start with regular Monday and Tuesday trash customers wherever those areas are accessible. If you are able, we encourage you to download the AVL collects app to your phone to receive notifications about trash and recycling pickup in your area. There will be no recycling pickup until the recycling plant is operational. Residents that use both recycling and trash carts for household waste. It is critical that storm debris is not being picked up at this time. These materials will be collected separately by a contractor in the future and at this time, unfortunately, we do not have that information available in terms of the timeline. Bus service, limited art bus service relaunch today and it started at 8 a.m. and it will be service will be servicing until 5 p.m. but that is because of the curfew and remember there is a curfew until 7.30 p.m. today starting at 7.30 p.m. today. We are doing our best to be innovative in these challenging times. So to make bus service the easiest for people of all abilities, riders can board the bus from any point along routes by flagging a bus down. Please, please only do this for a bus traveling on the side of the street that you are on. Safety must continue to be our top priority. Information about transit service availability can be found through service alerts or by calling transit customer service which is available from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day this week at 828253.5691. We understand cellular service and internet connectivity remain a challenge for many including our staff involved in the recovery effort. There are mobile cellular sites located at the YMCA at 30 Wiffen Street. Gross United Methodist Church at 954 Tonne Road. Asheville Middle School at 211 South French Broad Avenue and Dr. Wesley Grant Senior Southside Community Center at 285 Livingston Street. These sites offer limited cellular reception within several city blocks from where the trailers are parked. The sites at Middle at Asheville Middle and Dr. Wesley Grant Senior Southside Community Center also have places to charge your phones. If you are able to make it to these sites we encourage each of you to sign up for AVL alerts. There's a link on the front page of the city's website at www.ashvillenc.gov. Text message alerts seem to be one of our most reliable ways to get direct messages to our community and they are being sent in both English and Spanish. For those receiving messages please note messages in English are being followed by messages in Spanish. The banner notifications on your phone show the latest message. If you see a message in Spanish please open the text on English message preceding it. I'm going communication about businesses re-opening our to receive an issue permits for structures and buildings that have received storm damage. Permit fees will be waived for removal and repair permits and emergency permits will be fast tracked. Accessors and city staff will have identification and will identify which departments they are working for. For questions about buildings affected by the storm please call 8-8 259-5846. Electronic applications can be submitted to develop-ashvillenc.gov. More information about businesses re-opening will be available in the coming days. Every day we are hearing stories of our community's incredible resilience during these devastating times. But if you are able to volunteer to help please visit handsonashville.org for more information about ways to volunteer. I'd also like to share a big thank you again to the mayor and council and state and federal elected officials who are diligently working in the community at water distribution sites and doing whatever to connect with both public and private entities to request resources for our community to support this recovery effort. Lastly I want to say a big thank you to all of our city of ashville employees and I know every time I come up all throughout my messaging I am saying thank you to our city employees. I am humbled to lead this team of extraordinary public servants. I know we're all in this together and we'll continue to support each other as we recover as a community. I would now like to bring up Ben Whitty who will give us an update on our progress to restore our water distribution system. Mr. Whitty. Thank you Miss Campbell. Again Ben Whitty Assistant City Manager. City of ashville I'm going to provide an update on our progress on water restoration. I have a few images today that we'll share as well. I just want to start I want to kind of ground us so this the city and our partners we were really able to mobilize access plants and distribution plants beginning on Monday September 30th. We had to wait for the flood waters to recede and we had to be able to remove debris. So today is the end of week one of restoration in the beginning of week two of restoration. So we've accomplished a lot in a week and I'm going to provide an update on that today. So we're going to start it north fork and we talked on Friday about the importance of reestablishing the bypass line. We showed a number of images and drone footage and so the first image that you see on the screen number one this is Friday night so this is after my update on Friday these are the contractors working overnight and this is the site of the bypass line. So I'm going to make sure the slide that part of the screen so this is the same work site thank you. And so what you see here is you see our contractors TNK utilities and TNOCA who are making progress on the reconstruction of that bypass line. If you remember on Friday we showed you an elbow joint that was being brought in to be installed. So what you see now is the elbow joint and an additional joint are under construction. So you can see the progress on that bypass line overnight. And this next image is a little bit to give some context of what that looks like. So a joint and a line is installed incrementally. The red circle you see around that work area is called a shoring box. So the work area has to be stabilized so the workers can be in that box safely and cross this creek bed until we're able to reinstall the bypass line. And one of the things that I want to know about that work is we'll go to the next image. So this is another look of kind of what that looks like again. You can see the elbow elbow joint going deeper into the ground. You can see in this picture they're actually covering a portion of the L-advanced one more slide. Again, same work is occurring. You can see the shoring box. And so why this is important is it just shows you the incremental nature of this bypass line and how it's installed. And this is a really important photograph that I want to share. I'm going to talk about this for a minute. So what you see again to orient yourself you see the shoring box on the lower part of the picture and you see where our crews are. And on the upper right hand or the top of the picture you see a pipe and that is where I showed the the mark or drone operator was we showed pictures of him at that location. So that's the area that I showed to demonstrate where we lost 25 feet of bank. So you see we are making our way to that connection point. That's where we have to get to to be able to to complete this work on the bypass. So what makes this difficult and what I want to show is you see the area they're working is those are those are dry conditions. The area they need to work is still in the creek beds that we talked about is ten years to be fed by the spillway from the daisies. So what has to happen is when they complete this work where you see the workers that now they will have to go install shorings and have to divert the water that exists there. So we have to have dry areas to be able to install this pipe. So you can see the process that it takes to get across this creek bed. The other thing I want to note on this and this is again important to know how this this happens is we as we sequence this work. We've actually removed part of the pipe where you saw our drone operator film on Friday and we did that because so we have we have a longer way to go to connect this bypass line but that's because we were able to put a camera in that line over the weekend and we found that that line was clogged with boulders. So as these pipes wash away the pipes that remain are going to get sediment boulders, rock, debris in them. So when we make these connections we have to make sure that we're connecting to a open pipe. So the way we dealt with the boulders is we removed that section of the pipe. It was damaged and that's another segment we have to install. So that's really the process that you're going to see to get this bypass line connected and as I said on Friday once we can connect the bypass line and put water into that system that's how we return service to 80% of our water system. And what we we are optimistic we are very hopeful that we can have this work done on the bypass line in 72 hours. We feel good about that. Things happen but we want to say that and once we have the bypass line connected that is a significant major milestone in the restoration of the water system. But what I want to do today as well I want to orient the community to the other piece of restoration and that's and I'm going to take a few minutes to talk about the status of our North Fork Reservoir and Treatment Plant. So this is where the water comes to to charge or to put water into our distribution system. So the picture you see right now that's our North Fork Reservoir. That water source was was purchased and established many many decades ago. It is surrounded by 20,000 acres of forest. It is one of the most protected water seds in the United States. It is often considered to be one of the most pristine sources of drinking water in the United States. This is a crystal clear water body on a normal day. This is a picture saying picture this is after the storm and it's an essentially the best way I can describe this water system or this water body excuse me. It's effectively like chocolate milk. So it's went from one of the cleanest water supplies in the United States to what I would again I would term is chocolate milk. It's that murky. So the task at hand for the North Fork Reservoir is that this turbidity which is a technical term but it will just call it murky water. The sediment or the turbidity has to begin to settle before we are able to put it into a filter system and clean it. So that's something that we're monitoring. But what happens is every day that passes the turbidity and that water begins to settle. That's a natural process and that's occurring as we are making these repairs to the distribution system. One of the things that is important to note is we are able to intake water at different depths. So there's different points in the water column that we can get water into the treatment system when it's ready. We're able to change that. So we're monitoring the water column. Thanks for we know where the water is that has a little amount of turbidity and that's what we'll be able to get the water from when that time comes. The other thing that I want to note is we have we have EPA and FEMA officials that are on site. They're not only providing resources for this recovery effort but they're providing technical insists, a technical assistance on how we can treat this reservoir and what we can do to get water back to this community. So again we have those technical experts that are with us on site. And we're also with those technical experts. We're working on contingency plans to deliver non-pudable water to the distribution system while we continue to restore our treatment capacity. So we are looking at every way we can to get water into our distribution system. But I'll remind everybody none of that can happen until the distribution system is repaired. So these things are happening concurrently. What we hope to do is to be in a position to begin to pressurize the system once the reconstruction of the bypass line is completed. So I'm going to come back and talk about the distribution system in a minute. I didn't advance my slides but I just want to show a couple more pictures on what that looks like and I need to look. So this I talked about the turbidity in the reservoir. Well this is a picture of a filter. So this is where the water comes and it passes through this to be able to be treated and put into the distribution system. And that's very dark. But let me, this is a better picture. So what you see here is the water that's in our water treatment plant on the left. Again, I would describe that as chocolate milk on the right. That is crystal clear. So that is the difference in the water condition in our treatment plant before and after hurricane Helene. So again, these plant, these mud, these conditions, all this has to be cleaned and removed. So not only do we have to have water that we can treat, we have to have a plant that's in the condition to treat that. But I'll again, I'll go back and say we are making contingency plans to try to get water into the distribution system. So I'm going to move over to Mills River now. We've talked about that a lot. I have some good news from Mills River. Mills River plant is fully operational and we've actually reduced the pressure at that plant that sounds counterintuitive, but it's actually really good news. Because what that means is as we've been able to fully pressurize the southern, actual southern, and bunkum distribution area. So the area that Mills River service is now fully pressurized. And that's really good news because one is it means if you have water, you should not lose water in the South-Answer area. But the other thing that it means is we do not have any major breaks in the southern distribution system. Now we may still find small breaks as we begin to recover, but that's great news from Mills River. Now do you want to note one thing? I want to temper that. It is critical that if you're in the southern distribution center and you have water, it is critical that you continue to conserve water. Anybody that has water needs to conserve water. We have a long way to go. So I'll move to the distribution system. We've talked a lot about this. We showed a lot of imagery on Friday, but our contractors continue to make progress on large-scale repairs to our primary transmission lines. Those contractors for this city are TP Howard and TNOCA. We are also working closely with NC DOT and their contractors, and we are all working together to make these critical repairs to the distribution system. As we find them and as we have materials available, one thing I want to note, I want to just give a little bit of the challenge on that. So we are having to restore water, a water system and roads and do the design work. The engineering is actually happening in the field as the worker occurs. Normally you would have the engineers in the office. They would do the design work, then we would do a bid and do the construction. So all this is happening at once. So we have the contractors have their engineers, we have ours, we are engineering and building concurrently to restore the distribution system. And so we can talk more about this, but it's important to know that the way we've sequenced that repair to the distribution system is we begin at the points that are closest to the source of water. So we want to make sure that the distribution system that is in the closest proximity to north-work water treatment plant, those need to be repaired first and then we'll make our repairs out into the larger system. And we do it in that manner because that's the manner that the water is going to go into the system. It's going to start closer to the source and then it's going to make its way out into the other areas of the system. And the last thing I want to note is also when I make everybody where our city of actual water crews had a couple of questions on the number of employees, I've confirmed that we have 181 employees in the city of Asheville's water department. They are also making repairs and preparation for the restoration process. So this includes their out assessing, making repairs as they're found. And I want to be clear as the system pressurizes in the coming weeks, we will continue to find new breaks and leaks. So it's important to know that there are many, many breaks and leaks that we are not even aware of. Yeah, and we won't know those until we are able to pressurize the system. And that concludes my comments for today and I'm going to turn it over to Police Chief Mike Lamb. Thank you. Thank you, Ben. And good morning is, I guess, three minutes more of the morning. So my name is Mike Lamb. I'm the Chief of Police for the Asheville Police Department. And I'll be updating you on public safety and law enforcement operations within the city of Asheville. So currently we are operating with full patrol staffing and also full detective staffing. And we have 20% more officers that are volunteering to come in on their days off on average. These dedicated teams are working to find missing persons, to do drone and search and rescue operations. We're doing outside resource management. And also we have additional roving patrols in areas to prevent theft and burglary. So with our missing persons thus far, we have located 336 reported persons alive and well. Approximately, we have approximately 394 total persons that are reported missing to date on our missing persons spreadsheet. And currently we are actively working 60 cases of people that are missing and not heard from. Of those 60, 20 of those are folks that are unhoused. We have distributed face sheets to our officers so that they are aware of these missing persons, so that if they locate them in the community, that they can call us and that they can take them off the sheet. We're also receiving substantial assistance from the FBI and also Homeland Security and helping us with the missing persons list, but also helping us to identify deceased persons that we are recovering. We're also receiving additional DNA resources, DNA rapid testing instruments and consumables from donations from private sick. We're very appreciative of the donations of the material that helps us to be able to identify deceased persons and get closer to families. So over the weekend, we did a total of five rescues from our missing persons and welfare checks. I'll speak of two of those rescues. Bad situation where she was running out of the critical oxygen that she needs in order to survive. She had no cell phone coverage and was blocked in by down trees to her house. So officers were able to get her the medical attention and the oxygen that she needs. And they were also able to facilitate trees being removed from her driveway so that resources could get in and out of her house. The other one was a man who had broken his leg. He had no cell phone coverage and he also was blocked in. So officers were able to get him the critical medical attention that he needed. So from our deceased persons list and I want to clarify that this is within the city limits of Asheville, we have recovered nine deceased persons. And again, we were very thankful for the help from the FBI and Homeland Security on helping us to recover and identify those persons and also our search and rescue teams. With our drone team, we are working affected zones in and around the Swananoa River and also the French Broad River. We're working alongside search and rescue teams from the Asheville Fire Department but also New Jersey search and rescue. And we're also receiving substantial assistance from our private sector, from companies like Axon, Airworks, drone scents, and Paladin and helping us with additional pilots and additional resources for these critical drone operations. So we have a lot of outside agencies that are also assisting us. We have over 45 independent law enforcement agencies from across the state and nation that are providing assistance to us by giving us more resources so that we can be in more places to prevent more crime. We're also managing on average 190 officers every 24 hours. They are protecting critical infrastructure and also augmenting patrols for areas again that are experiencing violent crime and also theft and burglaries. Currently, we're working at a 40% higher call volume compared to the last three years during this time. That's an average of 85 more calls a day that officers are responding to. Over the past two days, we have been able to capture a homicide suspect from the one homicide and the two attempted homicides that we had last week. So of those incidents, we have been able to recover and arrest every one of those suspects. And over the weekend, we arrested three different individuals that were going around bearcage and attempting to loot businesses. So we're thankful that we were able to arrest those three and also from the help from the Holly Springs Police Department and helping us locate those people. And again, those additional resources that we have. So I want to remind everyone that we have a curfew. The curfews in effect from 730 pm to 730 am. Now, we realize that businesses are opening back up and water is being restored to certain areas of Asheville. So as that happens, we will re-evaluate the curfew and try and do what's best for the community overall. As a reminder to the public, please be aware of scammers. Scammers are coming into our area in order to take advantage of survivors. Never give cash to anyone representing themselves as a contractor. And do your due diligence to determine their licensing, their insurance coverage, and also their company credibility. So thank you very much. And please be helpful to each other out there and we thank or thankful for the community. Thanks. We know we provided a lot of information today in this 11am briefing. A few key things that we want to touch on before we open it up to questions from the media who are on a Zoom link. As of the morning update from Duke Energy, we still have 67,000 customers who are without power. Election services, that board of elections meeting will take place Tuesday at 330 pm, not 3 pm. Anyone who has questions about election services, you can call the Election Services Office at 828-250-4200. Again, an 828-250-4200. If you have phone phone service, they can help answer your questions. So you don't have to try to get into the office. They'll do what they can over the phone for you. And then there were some comments in the Facebook chat about waste probins. They didn't get collected at the end of the day. If those bins did not get collected, that means that waste probe could not make it to your service area that day. Pull those back in. We have extended hours at the landfill and we'll continue expanding that waste probe service as roads begin to be restored. So with that, we will turn it over to questions from the media in the Zoom chat. Question for Corinne Duncan, Mark Barrett with the New York Times. If she, what concerns does she have that the difficulties that elections will face, like a lot of other things in our society today, will decrease turnout? Sure. And just one thing with Corinne, the spelling of her name is C-O-R-I-N-E Duncan, and then it's pronounced Corinne. Sorry, for that point. Just for folks who are writing, I'll turn it in over to Corinne. Thank you, Lillian. So we're in the initial stages of assessing our voting locations and trying to contact our poll workers in order to make a plan for in-person voting. In general, early voting tends to be the most popular option because it has flexibility, so we're really trying to prioritize that and focus on that right now. The state board of elections will also be providing some flexibility, hopefully. They met during this briefing, so we'll get some more information on that as we go. Concerns for us specifically are the water situation, so making sure that we have sanitary conditions at the polling locations, we get fortepaddies, those kind of things. And we're working with the state board to address those issues and we are getting support. So, Lillian from Blue Ridge Public Radio had some questions for Ben. Hey, Ben, thank you so much for all that information. I just want to make sure that we understood this correctly. So it's about 72 hours for the bypass line to be connected. And then once that happens, the next steps are with the distribution lines and we don't yet have a timeframe on that. And it sounds like, I mean, correct me from wrong here, it sounds like the lines that are going to get fixed first are the ones closest to the plant. Can we infer from that that people who live closest to the plant are going to get restoration of water soonest, or is it something where the lines have to be fully repaired and throughout the system before you can start pumping water into it? So I really appreciate that question actually. And thank you because I do want to make sure I'm clear on what we're saying here and you were correct in your assessment. So we've talked about the bypass line a lot and the importance of that to take the part of the infrastructure. So yes, what I am saying is that we hope to have that installed or connected later this week. So that's what this is. The 72 hours is nothing more than that height. That is it. So just want to be clear on that. And that is a remarkable feat because if you saw the conditions that exist when they started, they have engineered designed or contractors boblas and they are going to build that rebuild that in a matter of a little over a week. That is remarkable and amazing progress. So we just wanted to share that. But you also correct, that doesn't mean that we can put water in that pipe in 72 hours. That doesn't mean that the distribute, the rest of the distribution system is prepared to accept water. So I am only saying that pipe is done and I will say today our restoration to water is still measured in weeks, not days. So I just want to be clear on that. But I also acknowledge that that's perceptive. You're right, when water restoration does begin, it will happen to closest to the source of the water. And it will spread out from there. So the closest and the lowest elevation areas will likely receive water first and it builds from there. Also important to note that restoration requires it's methodical. We have to make sure pressures are correct. We have to look for lines that that may explode when we pressurize them. So it is a systematic, methodical process to restore water. And I do it again. I appreciate the clarification. I appreciate the question on the clarification. Thank you. Thank you. Can I ask you one more question about you mentioned the, and you showed us the dry conditions in that area that you need to be able to work and then that you still have water on the creek. So is it basically that you have to get that bypass line in over the next 72 hours before you can shore up upstream to keep that creek from the work that you need to do? Yes, we have to get that bypass line under our new creek. So yes, and that is, that again, that has to happen in sections because we're not able to do that work when there's water there. So they have to put in shoreing, you know, do a lot of gradings required to do this. So yes, once we get the bypass line under the creek, we'll have another elbow and we'll be able to connect to the line that you saw in the photograph where our drone operator was on Friday. Thank you. Great. Thank you. Have some other water questions, but they're about like water distribution for city or county managers. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. What's your question, Laura? I have a couple. One is about the non-potable water distribution. We have a reporter who's at the Asheville Medical site and our understanding is that they are not distributing non-potable water there. I want to make sure that we heard clearly the the messages that there is non-potable water at all of the city and county sites. And then if you have clarification on why there might not be that distribution at the middle school, we'd love to know that as well. I see the city manager walking this way. I'll defer that to city manager Deborah Campbell. Hello again. And the information that I have is that there should be water available for flushing. And I don't know if the if it is categorized as non-potable, but it should you should have and be able to get water for flushing. We can share that we can share that with the city's PIO team and have them follow up with you directly on that response. Great. Thank you. Could I ask a couple questions of Vick Eisley? Vick is walking this way. Great. Good afternoon. Afternoon. Just wanted to ask sort of a broad question for people who may not have full understanding of how the TDA functions and what the parameters are in terms of regulations about how that money is permitted to be expended. And wondering if there has been any leniency. We've had a lot of reporting prior to the storm about the state law requirement that you have to use funds for infrastructure and some portion and the rest to promote tourism. Is there latitude on the state regulations about how you were able to allocate that money? Thank you. In the state of North Carolina, each county has its own legislation that is passed through the North Carolina General Assembly. Bunkham counties was changed two years ago to form to the state guidelines, which is two thirds to marketing and promotion, and one third to capital community projects. That is what our legislation is today and we are bound by that. That is why when we are looking at establishing the Always Asheville Fund, is we have what is called an Earned Revenue Fund, which comes from advertising revenue share or bookings from our website at exploreashful.com. So it is not restricted the way the occupancy tax funds are. So we are able to put that into the Always Asheville Fund to work for microgrants for our small business community. And how much is in that Earned Revenue Fund? So we are transferring 300,000 into the Always Asheville Fund. There is 370,000 in it today. And then we have $50,000 in pledges to start from destinations and travel and hospitality partners around the country. And that is just the beginning. And if you had any indication from lawmakers, as you said, there is a statutory requirement for the six-panditure that they might offer some flexibility or latitude given the tremendous circumstances we are under. That is a great question. And we all have a role to play and that is where we are into talking with our city and county officials, which definitely have their hands full with FEMA and core of engineers and that core infrastructure that Ben just talked about. We do know that the North Carolina legislature goes back into session Wednesday this week. My understanding is there is going to be discussion about a big relief. Opportunity, whether one is tabled or not, I am unsure of, but I know that it is definitely on the minds of our legislature in North Carolina. Both Tim Moore and Phil Berger were here in Asheville on Friday. And I know that all of our local delegations have been very active as well. We have been in discussions with them, but I think they are a bigger fish to fry in terms of the scale of what is needed in terms of relief for our community. And as I mentioned in my comments before, there are assets that were currently under renovation. And we are looking really good, like the Asheville Municipal Golf Course, the WNC Nature Center, as well as the JBL Soccer field. So we need to do an assessment with our city and county partners of which of those are still viable projects. And I think we'll probably get to that sometime later next week. It's just putting things in motion and in order here. And if we understood your comments earlier correctly, you are pausing on advertising, obviously in the present moment. Do you have a timeframe that you anticipate how long that might be? And could you talk a little bit about bouncing tourism with the needs to receive? Laura, you were going in and out there for a moment, but yes, we have we have paused all paid advertising and the million dollar sponsorship that we were doing. You're absolutely. Sorry, is there anyone there? I lost it. Oh, there it goes. Yeah, it's a meeting hall. The bill is there. Take over both. I would have. I'd better excuse. I'm so glad. I have a lot of training to return to our board. Lucky, look it looks like classroom. Pierre. Again, Laura, could you repeat the questions? I was just asking about your pause on advertising and how long you might anticipate that would be. And then also sort of balancing the need for tourism revenue against the obvious, you know, tremendous loss and restoration. You're trying to we're trying to get done here. Yes. There as I mentioned in my comments, we believe the comeback will come in stages. We're trying to get done here. Yes. We're trying to get done here. Yes. There as I mentioned in my comments, we believe the comeback will come in stages and in pockets. We want to make sure that there's infrastructure available for our residents, workers and emergency responders that are helping put our community back together. And so we want to make sure that we're working through when it is safe to open for commerce, making sure that that's that's for our residents as well as guests from within our community. So we're going to be working with folks here and with our colleagues at visit and see which is the state tourism office. We can start one question for police chief lamb. Larley at BPR. I'm sorry. I don't know the connection. Set that on. Hey, Laura. Hi, thanks for all that you are you all are doing. I wanted to ask about the missing people that you said you we are still you all are still actively looking for. I'm wondering if you considered making that ID known if there's ways that the public could assist in trying to find and identify these people. So yeah, we are working with the register of deeds office and sharing that information back and forth with them between folks that are missing within Bunkham County because we've we've received some addresses out of the county and also in Henderson County. We're working together with Bunkham County, the register of deeds with Henderson County and again, also with our federal partners to make sure that we're not duplicating work. And again, you know, we had 383 missing persons, I think total and then we've whittled it down to where there's there's the 60. So we believe that we can look at doing some kind of face sheet, especially for our unhoused folks so that we can have the public looks help and identifying them and taking them off the list. Thank you. So we can understand sort of what the register of deeds is doing relative to what you all are doing because we understand those numbers are several hundred more than that. Is that list just because it's a wellness checklist and you all have people that you know are missing. I'm just trying to understand why that number might be so much higher than than the 60 that you mentioned. So the register of deeds they have all sorts of folks like folks whose phones may not be working who they're just going to check on. So not actually the same list that the Asheville police is working from, but where those volunteers can assist they are doing so. So that's why you see two different lists. The Asheville police list is more around specific needs and specific concerns. And so that wraps up about the time that we have did want to provide an update from city of Asheville on those water distribution sites. They do have bulk water there that you can use for flushing and so bring those own your own containers for those bulk water sites. And then they will get you taken care of with water for both drinking and flushing. We thank you for joining us here today. We will be back at 11 a.m. tomorrow for our next community update. We know that folks are using their precious car batteries to listen to this in areas where there's still no power. And so we appreciate you joining us and tuning in and we will talk to you again tomorrow. Thank you.

## Corrine Duncan

Thank you, Avril. I'm Corrine Duncan. I'm the Director of Elections for Buncombe County. I'm here to reassure our community that Buncombe County will vote. All of our staff and board members are accounted for, and despite personal hardship, we've been organizing to make sure this community has a voice in choosing the people that represent us, both in good times and in tragedy.

We are now open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. to assist you. We have power but no water. Early voting will begin next week on October 17th. Absentee by mail is happening now, and Election Day will take place on November 5th. 

Obviously, we no longer have access to the facilities or the number of poll workers in our original plans. Our office and equipment were spared. We're working with our emergency team and the State Board of Elections to strategize and modify plans. As we speak, the State Board of Elections is meeting to discuss emergency measures to support the needs of affected counties. A virtual press briefing discussing the changes will be held today at 2 p.m. and you can find that link at [ncsbe.gov](http://ncsbe.gov).

Locally, we will hold a board meeting tomorrow at 3:30 p.m. where we will begin processing absentee ballots and discuss modifications to our early voting plan. That meeting is a public meeting and will be held at 59 Woodfin Place in Asheville. 

Our phone system is spotty but improving, so call us if you can. If you're able to access the internet, you can find information on our website at [buncombecounty.org/vote](http://buncombecounty.org/vote), including registration forms and the online absentee by mail request portal. Email us with your questions at elections@buncombecounty.org.

An important note, the information on our website about early voting and Election Day will be updated as soon as we are able to solidify plans. We are assessing what voting locations are available and working to make contact with our poll workers to train them. Poll workers, if you're hearing this, training is still happening and we still need you. We're working to find ways to contact you. If you can contact us, please do so. If you're available and you are already signed up for training, show up. 

Absentee by mail is available now. We anticipate an increase in this method of voting and are increasing our capacity to meet that demand. All ballots that have been requested so far have been mailed out. Absentee voting is available to any North Carolinian. To request one, use the online portal or a paper form and do so by October 21st. You can return your ballot by mail, in person, at our office, or at any early voting location. 

The deadline to return your ballot is Election Day, November 5th by 7:30 p.m. If you have already requested a ballot and need to change the mailing address due to evacuation, contact us. In order to vote, you need to be registered. The registration deadline is this Friday, October 11th. You can get the form online or by visiting us. 

The same applies to checking your status or finding your sample ballot. You can do so by using the NC voter search tool online or by coming to see us. For photo ID for voting, you can also get that for free at our office. 

We must respect the gravity of our situation. Basic needs come first, recovery is ongoing, and we'll have to be flexible, adapt, and work together, but Buncombe County will have the opportunity to securely vote this election. Thank you. 

Now we'll hear from Jessica Silver, Buncombe County Environmental Health.

## Jessica Silver

Good morning, today I'm going to share an update about well water safety and food service establishments. Your well may have been damaged or flooded, and we highly recommend that flooded or damaged wells be disinfected and sampled prior to using it. A flooded or damaged well must be disinfected. If water went over the top of your well, consider that flooded. 

Please go to [BuncombeCounty.org/EH](http://BuncombeCounty.org/EH) for instructions on how to disinfect your well. Second, after disinfecting your well, you'll want to make sure that you get a water sample. There are three ways you can request a water sample. 

First, you can call 828-422-7000. You can also visit [BuncombeCounty.org/EH](http://BuncombeCounty.org/EH) and make a water sample application online. You can also visit 30 Valley Street Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. and apply in person. We do ask for patience as we visit homes to collect water samples. We are prioritizing impacted areas amid our high call volume. Once we collect the sample, it does take at least 24 hours to run the sample and receive a result. 

Environmental health staff are also making visits to food service establishments across the county to make sure they are operating safely. We are working on a way to provide a list of establishments that we have visited. Thank you.

## Vic Eisley

Good morning. I am Vic Eisley, president and CEO for Explore Asheville and the Buncombe County Tourism Development Authority. Like the rest of our community, Explore Asheville and the Tourism Development Authority have been heartbroken by the devastating personal, natural, and economic loss from Hurricane Helene that our region has endured over just the last 10 days, and we are very heartened by the gumption, the grit, the sense of responsibility that our region has shown us.

We are keeping our Appalachian community top of mind and in our hearts in the wake of this unprecedented tragedy. Communities across Western North Carolina, including ours, are beginning to recover after this devastating wind, flood, and aftermath of Hurricane Helene. 

On Thursday, September 26, Explore Asheville published a travel advisory and sent an email alert to our 2,000 area business partners and media, including referrals to hotels open to accepting restaurants needing to take shelter. Little did any of us know what was to come in the next 24 hours for our deeply rooted community.

In the early hours following the storm, we took stock of our families and neighbors and checked in on the well-being of our team members. We ceased all paid advertising and promotion by Saturday afternoon, September 28th. We shared information via our social channels of what we could assess at that time, and for the time being, we've urged visitors to love us from afar, encouraging them to donate to help people of Asheville and Buncombe County. 

Our priority has been and continues to be to care for our residents, workers, and to support the first responders locally and those who have answered the call from all over the country, helping those impacted and addressing the economic and emotional toll at hand. Through this tragedy, the heart of hospitality has been a beacon of light. 

Restaurant owners cleaned out their walk-in refrigerators and cooked meals for thousands of residents and first responders. Lodging owners and operators without power, water, and very few staff, opened rooms for first responders working 24 to 48 hour shifts. Pools were drained for flushing water to maintain operations as best they could. 

In just the last week, we worked together to solve for sourcing clean linens for first responder rooms, and tanker trucks of water to get them operational so they can house more first responders. Our team contacted all groups, conferences, and events through the month of October and encouraged them to rebook Asheville at a later date. 

We established a clearinghouse for lodging for first responders, linemen, and emergency workers. First responder organizations or companies providing services, you can now email responder lodging at exploreasheville.com for lodging availability in Buncombe County. 

When FEMA announced on September 29th that federal disaster assistance was made available to the state of North Carolina, including our county, we shared how to apply for federal funding available to affected individuals, including grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of this disaster.

For individuals that need temporary housing or shelter, you can apply for assistance with FEMA. Once your application is approved, they provide a list of FEMA-approved lodging options for you. For more information, please go to [DisasterAssistance.gov](http://DisasterAssistance.gov).

In addition to the North Carolina Works Disaster Unemployment for people in our community, Giving Kitchen and Southern Smoke Foundation provide aid for food service employees, the Meetings Industry Fund, and the Search Foundation offer grants for members of the meetings and hospitality industry. There's an application process for each. 

We are reminding folks that as of October 4th the U.S. Small Business Administration opened a Small Business Assistance Center with our friends at the Asheville Area Chamber of Commerce at 36 Montford Avenue. The center provides personal business assistance for businesses, nonprofits, homeowners, and renters who have been impacted by the storm, a place to personally apply for low-cost financial assistance for their recovery. 

This will provide much-needed loans, but our small, independent business community needs significant grants. We learned from our friends in places like Puerto Rico that federal grants were also made possible for businesses through the EDA and HUD. 

We aim to work with our local, state, and federal officials to unlock the much-needed funding for our region that will be needed for months to come. We all have a role to play, and together we will provide for our community, and together we are charting a pathway forward.

Amid the heartache, there are also rays of light. Just an hour ago, a Concert for Carolina was announced, featuring Luke Combs, Eric Church, Billy Strings, James Taylor, and friends. It will take place on October 26th at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, with all proceeds, including sponsorships, going towards aid relief. Explore Asheville and the Tourism Development Authority has pledged $1 million as presenting sponsor. 

Millions more will flow back to our communities in need thanks to Luke Combs and Eric Church. We've been humbled and uplifted by the outpouring of care and concern from fellow destinations, travel, and hospitality friends around the country. Many of them have faced their own challenges and crises in their communities and are now pledging their aid to our travel and hospitality community.

We are heartened by their support, so much so that Explore Asheville, our 501(c)(3) non-profit, has established the Always Asheville Fund to help our small, independent travel and hospitality businesses throughout the county recover from the devastating impacts of the storm. 

Assisting our small businesses with emergency grants, not loans, will aid in part to sustain this deeply rooted creative community that we all love. To that end, we are transferring $300,000 from our earned revenue fund into the Always Asheville Fund this week. Destinations International advised they have pledges of $50,000 to begin. 

More information about the grant process will be available later this week at [exploreasheville.com/always-ashville-fund](http://exploreasheville.com/always-ashville-fund). We are also exploring other options for recovery in the near, medium, and long haul. This includes evaluating the status of community capital projects that are currently in the Tourism Product Development Fund and the Legacy Investment from the Tourism Fund with our partners at the city, county, and non-profit partners.

Since 2001 we've committed nearly $100 million to 50 community projects, and early indications are that some of them have sustained damage including the JBL soccer fields and the Asheville Municipal Golf Course, which was just under renovation. 

We are going to be able partners to help bring community assets back online. Much like we did during the pandemic, we're gathering ways that people outside of Asheville can purchase art and items online to support our local businesses. 

This storm could not have come at a worse time for our community. Peak October revenues carry many of our businesses and therefore many of our residents through to the spring. Travel and hospitality are 20% of Buncombe County’s annual economy. Everything matters for business operations without water flowing, from manufacturing to hospitality, just like us for residents. 

They and we all need realistic information to be able to make the best decisions for families, team members, and businesses. Based upon our initial research and outreach thus far, we've determined that nearly 100 local small business partners are closed for the foreseeable future. We need water flowing to reopen commerce. 

We need commerce flowing to help sustain our resident population and neighborhoods where and when it's safe to do so. We need commerce to help bring back the vibrancy of this creative community. We are seeing progress, slow as it may be, and while travel may not be possible right now, we are asking the world to keep Asheville in their heart and when the time is right, we'll be ready to welcome them back with open arms.

Until then, we thank them for their love and support as we begin to rebuild. Our comeback is going to come in stages. Other than water, business and infrastructure downtown fared fairly well. In parts of South Asheville, businesses and residents have power and running water now. Our Asheville Regional Airport is operational. 

However, places like the River Arts District that took more than two years to build, 20 years of blood, sweat, and tears from local artists and business people, and investment from municipal partners and the Tourism Development Authority, it took just 20 years to destroy a lot, but it did not destroy our spirit. 

We are checking in with our friends in Black Mountain and Swannanoa, Biltmore Village. We're in constant contact with our team and partners at Biltmore, and we are also in touch with the National Park Service about the Blue Ridge Parkway. 

In the last 10 days, grown men have broken down in tears from exhaustion, grief, and the gravity of it all, and we are witnessing the gumption, the grit, and determination of this deeply rooted community to rise, and we are here for it. 

I also just want to share one more thing that came over from Mountain BizWorks on the small business rapid recovery funding. They just announced in a press release form the W.N.C. Strong Helene Business Recovery Fund made possible through a $7.5 million initial funding from the Golden Leaf Foundation. So check in with Mountain BizWorks for more relief on the way. Thank you.

## Deborah Campbell

Thank you. Before we turn to the city of Asheville, I just have a quick statement from Buncombe County Schools. They will be with us later this week to provide an update, but they wanted to let parents and students know that they are still continuing to work diligently to get students, teachers, and staff back in all forty-five schools. We'll have an update on a return to school as soon as possible from them. 

Next, we have city of Asheville here, city manager, Deborah Campbell, assistant city manager, Ben Woody, and chief Lamb will provide respective updates. 

Good morning. As was stated, I am Deborah Campbell and I serve as the city manager of Asheville, and as usual, I want to begin by expressing my heartfelt thanks for the support the community is providing to help us work through these unprecedented times and circumstances. 

I am so proud of the work of our community, our city team, especially along with our county, state, federal, private, and non-profit partners who are doing all that they can to assist us with this long-term recovery effort. Progress is being made every day, and I tell my team, every day has been better than the day before, but we cannot give a timeline as to when we will be fully recovered. 

Today is day 12 of the emergency response and recovery effort. We continue to focus our attention in these three priority areas: 

1. Address the basic needs of our most vulnerable populations as well as the broader community.
2. Water service restoration (and as you heard, assistant Ben Woody will be providing that update).
3. Public safety (Chief will provide that update).

I did have a lot of information about water distribution, but I think that you all have heard that from the county manager. So I will skip in terms of distribution and location sites and focus on just a little bit of data. 

As of our last report, the teams that I did distribution sites have distributed over 250,000 bottles of water. Nearly 5,000 gallons of bulk water have been distributed, nearly 11,000 meals ready to eat have been distributed, and 162 cans of baby formula.

Anyone who has been affected by this natural disaster to connect with FEMA's disaster survivor assistance teams to register for support. If you have received damage to your home, been without electricity, or been out of work, please register with FEMA to get the support you need. 

You can call 1-800-621-3362 or download the FEMA app on your cell phone or visit one of the sites to talk with someone in person. These sites are changing daily to best meet the needs of those needing help. So, today's sites will run from approximately 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Staff from FEMA will be available to help sign people up for FEMA resources at the following locations:

- AB Tech Shelter: AB Tech Conference Center, 16 Fernahurst Drive, between the conference center and the parking deck.
- Pack Square Park at 70 Court Plaza in downtown Asheville.
- New Bridge Baptist Church, 199 Elkwood Avenue in Asheville.
- Isaac Dixon Elementary School at 125 Hill Street.
- For our Spanish-speaking community, FEMA representatives will be on site in the Emma community at 528 Emma Street.

Now I'd like to give a little bit of information about city operations. City staff have been working around the clock to get our community back up and running. 

So today I'll share just a few highlights from our incredible Public Works teams. As of this morning, they have cleared over 1,300 trees, reopened 57 roads, continued to work tirelessly in extreme conditions to address washed out roads, slides, and sinkholes, which means that we have a long way to go and more of these issues to address. 

They've logged over 8,900 staff hours in support of disaster recovery efforts. Sanitation: Trash collection is beginning today and we'll start with regular Monday and Tuesday trash customers wherever those areas are accessible. 

If you are able, we encourage you to download the AVL Collects app to your phone to receive notifications about trash and recycling pickup in your area. There will be no recycling pickup until the recycling plant is operational. Residents should use both recycling and trash carts for household waste. 

It is critical that storm debris is not being picked up at this time. These materials will be collected separately by a contractor in the future, and at this time, unfortunately, we do not have that information available in terms of the timeline.

Bus service: Limited ART Bus Service relaunched today, and it started at 8 a.m. and will be servicing until 5 p.m. but that is because of the curfew and remember there is a curfew until 7:30 p.m. today, starting at 7:30 p.m. today. 

We are doing our best to be innovative in these challenging times, so to make bus service the easiest for people of all abilities, riders can board the bus from any point along routes by flagging a bus down. Please, please only do this for a bus traveling on the side of the street that you are on. Safety must continue to be our top priority. 

Information about transit service availability can be found through service alerts or by calling transit customer service, which is available from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day this week at 828-253-5691. 

We understand cellular service and internet connectivity remains a challenge for many, including our staff involved in the recovery effort. There are mobile cellular sites located at the following locations:

- YMCA at 30 Woodfin Street
- Gross United Methodist Church at 954 Tonnel Road
- Asheville Middle School at 211 South French Broad Avenue
- Dr. Wesley Grant Sr. Southside Community Center at 285 Livingston Street

These sites offer limited cellular reception within several city blocks from where the trailers are parked. The sites at Asheville Middle and Dr. Wesley Grant Sr. Southside Community Center also have places to charge your phones. If you are able to make it to these sites, we encourage each of you to sign up for AVL alerts. 

There's a link on the front page of the City's website at [www.ashvillenc.gov](http://www.ashvillenc.gov). This seems to be one of our most reliable ways to get direct messages to our community and they are being sent in both English and Spanish. For those receiving messages, please note messages in English are being followed by messages in Spanish. 

The banner notifications on your phone show the latest, and if you see a message in Spanish, please open the text on the English message preceding it. Ongoing communication about businesses reopening is also crucial. 

I receive and issue permits for structures and buildings that have received storm damage. Permit fees will be waived for removal and repair permits, and emergency permits will be fast-tracked. Assessors and city staff will have identification and will identify which departments they are working for.

For questions about buildings affected by the storm, please call 828-259-5846. Electronic applications can be submitted to [develop.ashvillenc.gov](http://develop.ashvillenc.gov). More information about businesses reopening will be available in the coming days. 

Every day we are hearing stories of our community's incredible resilience during these devastating times, but if you are able to volunteer to help, please visit [handsonashville.org](http://handsonashville.org) for more information about ways to volunteer. 

I'd also like to share a big thank you to the mayor and council and state and federal elected officials who are diligently working in the community at water distribution sites and doing whatever is needed to connect with both public and private entities to request resources for our community to support this recovery effort. 

Lastly, I want to say a big thank you to all of our City of Asheville employees, and I know every time I come up, throughout my messaging, I am saying thank you to our City employees. I am humbled to lead this team of extraordinary public servants. I know we're all in this together and we'll continue to support each other as we recover as a community. 

I would now like to bring up Ben Woody, who will give us an update on our progress to restore our water distribution system.

---

## Ben Woody

Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Ms. Campbell. Again, Ben Woody, Assistant City Manager, City of Asheville. I'm going to provide an update on our progress on water restoration. I have a few images today that we'll share as well. 

I just want to start, I want to kind of ground us. So, the City and our partners, we were really able to mobilize access to the water and to plants and distribution lines beginning on Monday, September 30th. We had to wait for the floodwaters to recede and we had to be able to remove debris. 

So today is the end of week one of restoration and the beginning of week two of restoration, and so we've accomplished a lot in a week and I'm going to provide a update on that today. So we're going to start at North Fork, and we talked on Friday about the importance of re-establishing the bypass line. 

We showed a number of images, some drone footage, and so the first image that you see on the screen is from Friday night. These are the contractors working overnight. This is the site, so I'm going to go to the next slide. 

You can see the progress on that bypass line overnight. This next image gives a little bit more context of what that looks like. The red circle you see around that work area is called a shoring box. 

The work area has to be stabilized so the workers can be in that box safely and cross this creek bed until we're able to reinstall the bypass line. So that's one of the things that I want to note about that you can see in this picture. 

So what makes this difficult, and what I want to show is you see the area they're working in, those are dry conditions. The area they need to work is still in the creek beds that we talked about. It continues to be fed by the spillway from the dairies. 

So what has to happen is when they complete this work, where you see the workers now, they will have to go install shorings and have to divert the water that exists there. So we have to have dry areas to be able to install this pipe so you can see the process that it takes to get across this creek bed.

Another important note is we have actually removed part of the pipe where you saw our drone operator film on Friday, and we did that because we have a longer way to go to connect this bypass line. 

That's because we were able to put a camera in that line over the weekend and we found that that line was clogged. As these pipes wash away, the pipes that remain are going to get sediment, boulders, rock, debris in them. So, when we make these connections, we have to make sure that we're connecting to an open pipe. 

The way we dealt with the boulders is we removed that section of the pipe. It was damaged, and that's another segment we have to install. So that's the process that you're going to see to get the pipes cleaned. 

This bypass line connected, and as I said on Friday, once we can connect the bypass line and put water into that system, that's how we return service to 80% of our water system. 

We are optimistic; we are very hopeful that we can have this work done on the bypass line in 72 hours. We feel good about that. Things happen, but we want to say that, and once we have the bypass line connected, that is a significant major milestone in the restoration of the water system. 

But what I want to do today as well, I want to orient the community to the other piece of restoration and that's—I'm going to take a few minutes to talk about the status of our North Fork Reservoir and Treatment Plant. 

This is where the water comes to charge or to put water into our distribution system. The picture you see right now, that's our North Fork Reservoir. That water source was purchased and established many decades ago. 

It is surrounded by 20,000 acres of forest. It is one of the most protected watersheds in the United States. It is often considered to be one of the most pristine sources of drinking water in the United States. 

This is a crystal clear water body on a normal day. This is a picture, the same picture, this is after the storm, and essentially, the best way I can describe this water system, or this water body, is effectively like chocolate milk. 

It went from one of the cleanest water supplies in the United States to what I would again, I would term as chocolate milk. It's that murky. So the task at hand for the North Fork Reservoir is that this turbidity, which is a technical term, but we'll just call it murky water, this sediment has to begin to settle before we are able to put it into a filter system and clean it. 

So that's something that we're monitoring, but what happens is every day that passes, the turbidity in that water begins to settle. That's a natural process and that's occurring as we are making these repairs to the distribution system. 

One of the things that is important to note is we are able to intake water at different depths. So there's different points in the water column that we can get water into the treatment system when it's ready. We were able to change that sort of monitoring the water column where the water is that has the least amount of turbidity, and that's where we'll be able to get the water from when that time comes. 

The other thing that I want to note is we have EPA and FEMA officials that are on site. They're not only providing resources for this recovery effort, but they're providing technical assistance on how we can treat this reservoir and what we can do to get water back to this community. 

Again, we have those technical experts that are with us on site, and with those technical experts, we're working on contingency plans to deliver non-potable water to the distribution system while we continue to restore our treatment capacity. 

So we are looking at every way we can to get water into our distribution system, but I'll remind everybody, none of that can happen until the distribution system is repaired. So these things are happening concurrently. 

What we hope to do is to be in a position to begin to pressurize the system once the reconstruction of the bypass line is completed. So I'm going to come back and talk about the distribution system in a minute. 

I didn’t advance my slides, but I'm just going to show a couple more pictures. So this, I talked about the turbidity in the reservoir. Well, this is a picture of a filter. So this is where the water comes and it passes through this to be able to be treated and put into the distribution system.

And that is very dark, but let me show you a better picture. So what you see here is the water that's in our water treatment plant on the left. Again, I would describe that as chocolate milk. On the right, that is crystal clear. So that is the difference in the water condition in our treatment plant before and after Hurricane Sandy.

We're going to have to have a plan to treat this. We're going to have to have a plan to treat this. Mills River plant is fully operational and we've actually reduced the pressure at that plant. 

That sounds counterintuitive, but it's actually really good news because what that means is we've been able to fully pressurize the southern Asheville-Southern Buncombe distribution area. So the area that Mills River services is now fully pressurized and that's really good news because, one, it means if you have water you should not lose water in the South Asheville area, but the other thing that it means is we do not have any major breaks in the southern distribution system. 

Now we may still find small breaks as we begin to recover, but that's great news from Mills. So we have a long way to go. 

We've talked a lot about this; we showed a lot of imagery on Friday, but our contractors continue to make progress on large-scale repairs to our primary transmission lines. Those contractors for the city are TP Howard and Tanoka. 

We are also working closely with NCDOT and their contractors, and we are all working together to make these critical repairs to the distribution system as we find them and as we have materials available. 

One thing I want to note is I want to just give a little bit of a challenge on that. We are, we were having to restore a water system and roads and do the design work. The engineering is actually happening in the field as the work occurs. 

Normally you would have the engineers in the office, they would do the design work, then we would do a bid and do the construction, so all this is happening at once. So we have the contractors have their engineers, we have ours, we are engineering and building concurrently to restore the distribution system. 

It’s important to know that the way we've sequenced that repair to the distribution system is we begin at the points that are closest to the water source. So we want to make sure that the distribution system that is in the closest proximity to North Fork water treatment plant needs to be repaired first and then we'll make our repairs out into the larger system. 

We do it in that manner because that's the manner that the water is going to go into the system—it's going to start closest to the source and then it's going to make its way out into the other areas of the system. 

The last thing I want to note is also want to make everybody aware that our City of Asheville water crews had a couple of questions on the number of employees. I've confirmed that we have 181 employees in the city of Asheville’s water department. 

They are also making repairs in preparation for the restoration process. So this includes they're out assessing making repairs as they're found and I want to be clear that as the system pressurizes in the coming weeks we will continue to find new breaks and leaks. 

So it's important to know that there are many breaks and leaks that we are not even aware of yet and we won't know those until we are able to pressurize the system. 

That concludes my comments for today, and I'm going to turn it over to Police Chief Mike Lamb.

## Mike Lamb

Thank you, Ben, and good morning. Mike Lamb, I'm the chief of police for the Asheville Police Department and I'll be updating you on public safety and law enforcement operations within the city of Asheville. 

Currently, we are operating with full patrol staffing and also full detective staffing, and we have 20% more officers that are volunteering to come in on their days off on average. These dedicated teams are working to find missing persons, conduct drone and search and rescue operations. 

We're doing outside resource management and also we have additional roving patrols in areas to prevent theft and burglary. Thus far, regarding our efforts with missing persons, we have located 60 individuals. We are currently working with people that are considered missing and not heard from. 

Of those 60 individuals, 20 of those are folks that are categorized as unhoused. We have distributed face sheets to our officers so that they are aware of these missing persons, so that if they locate them in the community they can call us and that they can take them off the sheet. 

We're also receiving substantial assistance from the FBI and also Homeland Security in helping us with the missing persons list but also helping us to identify deceased persons that we are recovering. We're also receiving additional DNA resources, DNA rapid testing instruments, and consumables from donations from the private sector. 

We're very appreciative of the donations of materials that help us to be able to identify deceased persons and give closure to families. Over the weekend, we did a total of five rescues from our missing persons and welfare checks. 

I'll speak of two of those rescues: One was a lady who was running out of the critical oxygen that she needs in order to survive. She had no cell phone coverage and was blocked in by downed trees to her house. So officers were able to get her the medical attention and the oxygen that she needed, and they were also able to facilitate trees being removed from her driveway so that resources could get in and out of her house. 

The other one was a man who had broken his leg. He had no cell phone coverage and he also was blocked in. So officers were able to get him the critical medical attention that he needed. 

From our deceased persons list, I want to clarify that this is within the city limits of Asheville. We've covered nine deceased persons, and we were very thankful for the help from the FBI and Homeland Security in helping us to recover and identify those persons, and also our search and rescue teams. 

With our drone team, we are working affected zones in and around the Swannanoa River and also the French Broad River. We're working alongside search and rescue teams from the Asheville Fire Department, but also New Jersey Search and Rescue, and we're also receiving substantial assistance from our private sector, from companies like Axon, Airworks, DroneSense, and Paladin in helping us with additional pilots and additional resources for these critical drone operations. 

We have a lot of outside agencies that are also assisting us. We have over 45 independent law enforcement agencies from across the state and nation that are providing assistance to us by giving us more resources so that we can be in more places to prevent more crime. 

We're also managing, on average, 190 officers every 24 hours. They are protecting critical infrastructure and also augmenting patrols for areas again that are experiencing violent crime and also theft and burglaries. Currently, we're working at a 40% higher call volume compared to the last three years during this time. 

That's an average of 85 more calls a day that officers are responding to. Over the past two days, we have been able to capture a homicide suspect from the one homicide and the two attempted homicides that we had last week. 

Of those incidents, we have been able to recover and arrest every one of those suspects, and over the weekend, we arrested three different individuals that were going around barricades to loot businesses. So we're thankful that we were able to arrest those three and for the help from the Holly Springs Police Department in helping us locate those people, and again, those additional resources that we have. 

I want to remind everyone that we have a curfew. The curfew is in effect from 7:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. Now we realize that businesses are opening back up and water is being restored to certain areas of Asheville. 

As that happens, we will reevaluate the curfew and try to do what's best for the community overall. As a reminder to the public, please be aware of scammers. Scammers are coming into our area to take advantage of survivors. Never give cash to anyone representing themselves as a contractor. 

We’re thankful for your time and your understanding. 

We provided a lot of information today in this 11 a.m. briefing. A few key things that we want to touch on before we open it up to questions from the media who are on a Zoom link:

1. As of the morning update from Duke Energy, we still have 67,000 customers who are without power.
2. The Board of Elections meeting will take place Tuesday at 3:30 p.m.; not 3 p.m.
3. Anyone who has questions about election services can call the election services office at 828-250-4200. 

If you have questions, they can help answer your questions so you don't have to try to get into the office. They'll do what they can over the phone for you. 

4. There were some comments in the Facebook chat about WastePro bins. If those bins did not get collected, that means that WastePro could not make it to your service area that day. Pull those back in. 

We have extended hours at the landfill and we'll continue expanding that WastePro service as roads begin to be restored. 

With that, we will turn it over to questions from the media in the Zoom chat.

## Questions and Answers

### Mark Barrett, New York Times

What concerns does Corinne have that the difficult elections will face, like a lot of other things in our society today, will decrease turnout? 

### Corrine Duncan

Sure, and just one thing with Corrine, the spelling of her name is C-O-R-I-N-N-E, Duncan, and it's pronounced Corrine. 

Thank you, Lillian. So we're in the initial stages of assessing our voting locations and trying to contact our poll workers in order to make a plan for in-person voting. In general, early voting tends to be the most popular option because it has flexibility, so we're really trying to prioritize that and focus on that right now. 

The State Board of Elections will also be providing some flexibility, hopefully. They met during this briefing, so we'll get some more information on that as we go. Concerns for us specifically are the water situation, so making sure that we have sanitary conditions at the polling locations.

### Laura Lee, Blue Ridge Public Radio

Ben, thank you so much for all that information. I just want to make sure that we understood this correctly. So it's about 72 hours for the bypass line to be connected, and then once that happens, the next steps are with the distribution lines, and we don't yet have a timeframe on that, and it sounds like, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong here, it sounds like the lines that are gonna get fixed first are the ones closest to the plant. 

Can we infer from that that people who live closest to the plant are going to get restoration of water soonest, or is it something where the lines have to be fully repaired throughout a system before you can start pumping water into it?

### Ben Woody

I really appreciate that question actually and thank you because I do want to make sure I'm clear on what we're saying here, and you were correct in your assessment. So we've talked about the bypass line a lot and the importance of that particular part of the infrastructure. 

Yes, what I am saying is that we hope to have that installed or connected later this week. So that's what the 72 hours is—nothing more than that pipe. That is it. I just want to be clear on that, and that is a remarkable feat because if you saw the conditions that exist when they started, they have engineered, designed, and our contractors mobilized, and they are going to build that, rebuild that in a matter of a little over a week. 

That is remarkable and amazing progress. But you are also correct that doesn't mean that we can put water in that pipe in 72 hours. That doesn't mean that the rest of the distribution system is prepared to accept water. 

So I am only saying that pipe is done and I will say today our restoration to water is still measured in weeks not days. So I just want to be clear on that but also acknowledge that that's perceptive .

### Laura Lee

You’re right, when water restoration does begin it will happen closest to the source of the water and it will spread out from there. 

### Laura Lee

Could you talk about that dry conditions in that area that you need to be able to work, and then that you still have water in the creek. Is it basically that you have to get that bypass line in over the next 72 hours before you can shore up upstream to keep that creek from the work that you need to do?

### Ben Woody

Yes, we have to get that bypass line under our new creek, so yes. That, again, has to happen in sections because we're not able to do that work when there's water there. So they have to put in shoring, a lot of grading is required to do this. 

So yes, once we get the bypass line under the creek, we'll have another elbow and we'll be able to connect to the line that you saw in the photograph where our drone operator was on Friday.

### Laura

Thank you. I have some other water questions, but they're about like water distribution for city or county managers.

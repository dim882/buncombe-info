**Lilian Govus:**  
Good morning. Today is Saturday October 5th and this is the 10 a.m. update. I'm Lilian Govus, Director of Communications and Public Engagement for Bunkham County. Today we'll be joined by Marian Tierney with FEMA and Jessica Silver with Bunkham County Environmental Health along with an update from County Manager Avril Pindert.

News today, Bunkham County has launched an online tool for residents to report storm related issues by uploading geotagged photos. This can include blocked roads, landslides, and urgent need for evacuation supplies or medicine. The photos will help emergency services respond faster and more accurately to specific locations. The website is live right now at report.bunkhamcounty.org. Please use this to report for emergency services only.

Again, it's report.bunkhamcounty.org. You'll take a photo with your phone, upload it to the website, and the geocode attached to that photo will tell emergency services where you are posting that photo from so we can get supplies, materials, and emergency supports to you. Do not use the take photo or video option because that will not transmit the location information. You need to take a photo, upload the photo, and that geocoded location information will be transmitted to our emergency services personnel.

I'll now turn it over to County Manager Avril Pindert.

**Avril Pindert:**  
Thanks, Lillian. Good morning. As of 9 a.m. this morning, there remain 74,293 customers without power. Go to doenergyupdates.com. That is doog energy updates one word.com for the latest update under outage.

Aschal Bunkham Air Quality Agency encourages residents to wait at least three days to let materials dry out before burning as that will help reduce emissions. Be sure to be at least 15 feet away from structures and in three-foot piles. Open burning of leaves, brush, and yard trimmings is permitted on burning days between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. To find out if it's a burn day, check abairquality.org or call 828-250-6767.

Again, 828-250-6767. You are allowed to burn anywhere that does not receive public yard waste pick. The burning of household trash, building materials, asphalt materials, cardboard, processed wood, and paper is always prohibited. Again, that is household trash, building materials, asphalt materials, cardboard, processed woods, and paper.

Burning is not allowed in the city of Asheville, the towns of Biltmore Forest, Flat Mountain, Montreat, Riverville, or Woodfin. So no burning in municipal areas. Our landfill is open today until one. A reminder that our transfer station at Hominy Creek remains closed until further notice.

Food and water distribution sites are open until 7 p.m. or until supplies run out. Please bring containers to refill water. These sites are:

- William Estes Elementary School, Overlook Road
- Sandhill Elementary School, Sandhill School Road
- North Windy Ridge Intermediate School, Windy Ridge Road, Riverville
- Fairview Elementary School, Charlotte Highway, Fairview

Now we'll turn it over to Jessica Silva with Bunkham County Environmental Health.

**Jessica Silva:**  
Good morning. Today I'm going to share information about well water safety, food service establishments, and childcare centers. Environmental health is working to make sure flooded wells or wells that were damaged during the storm provide safe water for your use at home.

Environmental health would like to provide you with information on the risk of wells that may have been flooded or damaged in the storm. A flooded well is a well where water was over the top of the well at any point during the storm. Your well may have also received structural damage. If your well was either damaged or flooded during the storm, you must disinfect the well. Directions for disinfecting your well can be found at www.bunkhamcounty.org/eh. Again, that's bunkhamcounty.org/eh.

Once your well has been disinfected, please call 828-250-5016 and we will have someone collect and test your water. Being without water is hard and we are all being creative when it comes to flushing. So we ask that you consider putting a filled two-liter bottle in the back of your toilet. This will reduce the amount of water that's needed for each flush. Also, you can think of ways that you can reuse water. For example, after you wash dishes, save that water for future flushing.

At this time, we advise not to use water from rivers, creeks, or streams due to contamination from the storm.

Our community has stepped up and our food service establishments have opened their doors to provide free meals to our residents in need. Environmental health staff is visiting food service establishments and providing information to operators on how they can reopen for business as safely and as quickly as possible.

Establishments can call or text 828-772-2820. Again, that number for establishments to call to request an assessment is 828-772-2820 or you may email EHrequest@buncomcounty.org and include 'restaurant' in the subject line.

We also recognize members of our community need to get back to work and to do that, childcare centers will need to reopen. Operators should reach out to their licensed childcare consultant for guidance.

At this time, I will pass it off to Marian Tierney with FEMA.

**Marian Tierney:**  
Good morning. I'm Marian Tierney. I'm the National Incident Management Assistance Team Lead Assigned here in Buncombe County. Again, our thoughts are with everybody that is still recovering and responding to the storm. This is a long road and FEMA will be with you every step of the way.

I want to provide some updates that will help you on the road to recovery. First of all, life safety remains our top priority. Search and rescue is still ongoing throughout the county. We ask that you be mindful of our first responders working alongside the roads and ensure that you are driving safely to allow them to continue their critical life safety mission.

To date, FEMA has received over 27,000 applications, which have been approved, and has provided over $27 million statewide. Specifically in Buncombe County, 14,000 applications have been approved and over $12 million has been dispersed to disaster survivors. This is critical assistance that will help people with immediate needs as well as displacement assistance if they can't stay in their home.

With that, I encourage you to register for disaster assistance if you have not done so. You can register by calling 800-621-FEMA or going to disasterassistance.gov. Disasterassistance.gov is all one word. If you are unable, because of communication connectivity issues, to register online or via telephone, you can visit our Disaster Survivor Assistance Teams, which are out in the community today.

We will have teams at the WNC Ag Center at 1801 Fannie Bridge Road. We'll also have people at Pack Square Park at 80 Court Plaza, A-B Tech Community College at 340 Victoria Road, as well as the Black Mountain POD at 310 East State Street.

In addition to these Disaster Survivor Assistance Teams that will be at these specific locations, we will also be canvassing the communities of Emma and Woodfin today. We will be canvassing additional communities in the coming days.

Again, in summary, I encourage you, if you have not registered for disaster assistance, to do so. It is the first step in the recovery process and we can provide immediate relief in terms of serious needs assistance to replace food, water, medicines, and other life safety critical items, as well as displacement assistance if you cannot stay in your home. Again, you can register by calling 800-621-FEMA, visiting disasterassistance.gov, or seeing one of our Disaster Survivor Assistance Teams in person.

Thank you.

**Lilian Govus:**  
Before we turn to taking questions from the community, I want to make sure there are a lot of phone numbers that were shared today. The best phone number to remember is 250-6100. That's our call center. It operates 24/7. Those call center operators have this information and can get you to the right people.

I know there are a lot of phone numbers shared, but if you call 250-6100, our call center operators will get you to the right place and make sure your needs are taken care of.

At this time, we will turn it open to questions from members of the media.

**Question 1 (from chat):**  
We have a question for Marian that came in at last night's briefing we weren't able to address. Is there any kind of assistance program for renters who rent mobile homes that have been damaged?

**Marian Tierney:**  
Yes, you can call in and register, and you would receive serious needs assistance. So again, I encourage all people who have been affected by the storm to register by calling 800-621-FEMA, registering online at disasterassistance.gov, or visiting with one of our Disaster Survivor Assistance Teams.

**Follow-up Question:**  
Is there specific help for undocumented immigrant victims of the disaster?

**Marian Tierney:**  
Our assistance to undocumented immigrants is limited. However, if a dependent in the household is a legal permanent resident or citizen, then the household may be eligible for assistance. The way to determine that would be to register and then we can work through those individual cases.

**Laura Lee (BPR):**

It's Laura at BPR. Marian, I had a question about the boots on the ground. How many boots are on the ground from FEMA?

**Marian Tierney:**  
We have 1,300 emergency responders on the ground right now from agencies across the country, including the Fire Department of New York. You'll see their trucks outside, but we have crews from across the country who are here. FEMA may be able to provide a specific FEMA-related number.

**Follow-up Question:**  
Do we have a specific number from FEMA?

**FEMA Representative:**  
It's currently over 3,000 federal responders on the ground in North Carolina, but we can get a precise number for you.

**Question 2 (from chat):**  
This question is for Environmental Health. Other than hand sanitizer, what can people do to help with personal hygiene?

**Jessica Silva:**  
People can use gloves if they're preparing food. They can also use hand washing or hand sanitizer. If you have a way to heat water, heat it, and wash your hands as often as you can. Once you use that water, consider putting it in the back of your toilet to reduce water usage. Hand sanitizer is the next best option to washing hands.

**Follow-up Question:**  
What about food-borne pathogens and other illnesses like norovirus, given our sanitation limitations?

**Jessica Silva:**  
Wash your hands as often as possible. That's the number one way to prevent food-borne illness. We should return to greeting each other with elbows instead of shaking hands to minimize the risk.

**Final Question:**  
How will people know when it's safe to go out to eat?

**Jessica Silva:**  
We started visiting establishments yesterday to ensure they are operating safely and have adequate water supplies. Some places have been given permission to reopen, either from us or the state section of Environmental Health. We'll continue visiting throughout the weekend, but we currently don't have a resource where residents can verify. We’ll consider adding that to our website.

**Lilian Govus:**  
It looks like that’s all the questions we have. We’ll be back here at 4 p.m. today for the next briefing, and again tomorrow at 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Stay strong. Thank you.

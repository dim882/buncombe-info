Now we'll turn it over to Jessica Silva with Boncom County Environmental Health. Good morning. Today I'm going to share information about well water safety food service establishments and childcare centers. Environmental health is working to make sure flooded wells or wells that were damaged during the storm provide safe water for your use at home. Environmental health would like to provide you with information on the risk of wells that may have been flooded or damaged in the storm. A flooded well is a well where water was over the top of the well at any point during the storm. Your well may have also received structural damage. If your well was either damaged or flooded during the storm, you must disinfect the well. Directions for disinfecting your well can be found at www.boncommecounty.org/eh. Again, that's boncommecounty.org/eh. Once your well has been disinfected, please call 828250-5016 and we will have someone collect and collect your water. Being without water is hard and we are all being creative when it comes to flushing. So we ask that you consider putting a field 2 liter bottle in the back of your toilet. This will reduce the amount of water that's needed for each flush. Also, you can think of ways that you can reuse water. For example, if you wash after you wash dishes or the dishwasher into the back of your toilet for future flushing. This time we advise not to use water from rivers, creeks or streams due to contamination from the storm. Our community has stepped up and our food service establishments have opened their doors to provide free meals to our residents in need. Our health staff is visiting food service establishments and providing information to operators on how they can reopen for business as safely and as quickly as possible. The establishments can call or text 8287722820 again that number for establishments to call to request an assessment is 8287722820 or you may email ehrequest@buncomcounty.org and include restaurant in the subject line. We also recognize members of our community need to get back to work and to do that childcare centers will need to reopen. Operators should reach out to their licensed childcare consultant for guidance. This time I will pass it all to Mary and Tierney with FEMA. Good morning. I'm Mary and Tierney.
